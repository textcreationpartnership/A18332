            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now for ſo much as the monumentall actes of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men famous for ſanctity of life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though repleniſhed with all exemplar ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues (as being further remote from our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice &amp; vnderſtanding) are not, in the minds of many men, of that validity, as of right they ſhould be, and moue for the moſt part rather admiration then deſire of imitation; whereupon ſome haue not feared now and then to affirme, that it is impoſſible for any one, now to arriue to that degree of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

vertue, which thoſe ancient men attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo happily vnto, as if, forſooth, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, the vigour of mindes, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall aſſiſtance ſhould be rebated. For this cauſe therfore, not without the ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God do there daily ſpring vp in the Church (which is adorned like a faire garden) ſome men like ſo many freſh plants and flowers, who aſpire towards heauen with a certaine exact manner of life; queſtionleſſe to the intent that we may clearly vnderſtand, that the hand of our Lord is not ſhortned, &amp; that we may as well now, as in times paſt be conuerſant in worſhipping God with offices of perfect ſanctity.</p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe was <hi>B.

To the intent that they who knew him not whilſt he was liuing, ſhould not be deſtitute of his ſo remarkable preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, God in his behalfe as he is wont to doe, moued the mindes of many, to note and ſet downe in writing thoſe thinges which they were giuen to vnderſtand of his life. For to omit, that his comming to religion is compendiouſly ſet downe in the Annuall

He that did principally ſet forth in writing the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Aloyſius, was Hieronymas Platus,</hi> the authour of that worke intituled, <hi>de Dignitate Cardinalis, ad Fratrem,</hi> and in like manner of that other, <hi>De bono status Religioſi,</hi> a man of rare guiftes both naturall and diuine, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially endued with an excellent iudgment and prudence, and with ſingular piety and Religion. He, when as at that time he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Nouices at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Houſe of the Profeſſed of the Society of IESVS, who are ſent thither to aſſiſt at Maſſe, to which place <hi>Aloyſius</hi> being as yet but a Nouice, repaired, on a tyme required of him, that he would orderly recount vnto him the whole courſe of his life, his purpoſe of imbracing religion, and finally all thoſe benefits which he receaued from Almighty God, whilſt he liued as yet, in the liberty of the world. Which truly, for ſo much as they ſeemed vnto him to proceed after a ſingular and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together an vnuſuall manner, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then from a certaine peculiar grace and fauour of God, the young man being gone
<pb facs="tcp:17839:8"/>
from him, he briefly ſet downe all thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in writing.</p>
            <p>Next vnto this man, I my ſelfe began to write his life at <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt he yet liued. For wheras in the Romane Colledge I was daily familiar, and in a manner inward with him, and perceaued that all who both heard and beheld his words, and manners, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to piety, no otherwiſe then men are wont to be who with a mind rightly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and a deſire to profit, read the actes of Saints, I was of an opinion, that the examples of his ſanctity, would worke the ſame effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall operation with ſtrangers, if they did but once entertaine a knowledge of him. Therfore out of a peculiar inſtinct (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) of God, out of a deſire to render a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to very many, I determined to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to writing his life. And this my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>F.

ſaying of the Wiſeman agreeth vnto him:</hi> Conſummatus in breui, expleuit tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora multa: <hi>Being conſummate in short ſpace, he fulfilled much time.

guiftes, which the Queene in teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards <hi>Martha</hi> beſtowed vpon her, the Marques eſpouſed her. But whilſt theſe eſpouſalls are accompliſhed, &amp; this whoſe buſines of the marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued, there fel out certayne things of ſuch remarkable ſanctity, that it ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared what fruite in tyme they ſhould bring forth. For <hi>Martha,</hi> ſo ſoone as ſhe knew from the Queene, that there was held a treaty of this match, to the end that it would pleaſe God to bleſſe the ſucceſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, cauſed often to be offered a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Maſſes, to the moſt holy Trinity, to the holy Ghoſt, to Chriſt, interpoſing the recitation of his bitter Paſſion, imploring the aſſiſtance of the Virgin Mother, of the Angells, and other Saintes. Afterward when they had written into <hi>Italy</hi> to both their friends, that they would be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend vnto this match, anſwere was opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely returned to the letters, at that time when all were imployed in procuring the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonies of the <hi>Iubily,</hi> lately diuulged at <hi>Rome.</hi> Therfore vpon the day of the Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:17839:20"/>
Furthermore the Queene, when as at that time ſhe was newly with child, &amp; could not as then forgo the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of <hi>Martha,</hi> whome euen from her comming out of <hi>France,</hi> ſhe had vſed as a companion for her ſolace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting confident in her loue, ſhe forbad her publique conuerſation with her husband, before her deliuery. It was done as ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. The day therfore being ſet dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by the Queene, whereupon there fell out commodiouſly the celebration of a certaine other Iubily, or plenary Indulgence, they iterating the ſacraments of Pennance &amp; the Euchariſt, were piouſly (as becometh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) all ſacred rites being duely perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ioyned in marriage, when as God was vnto them moſt appeaſed, and propitious. And now this is no leſſe worthy of memory, that amongſt the nuptiall rites, and feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall pompe, the Decrees of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councell, which accidentally at that tyme were promulgated throughout <hi>Spayne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt at this marriage to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>AFTER they were arriued at <hi>Castilion,</hi> the Marques his wife, ſo ſoone as ſhe perceaued herſelf to be disburdened of the imploiments &amp; incumbrances of the Court, and had gotten leaſure, and commodity to apply herſelfe more ſeriouſly to matter of deuotion, according to her accuſtomed affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, &amp; according vnto that which ſhe lately reſolued with herſelfe in <hi>Spayne,</hi> ſhe bent herſelfe more carefully vnto the ſame then euer heretofore. But her princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall deſire was to obtayne a Sonne, who in time to come might dedicate himſelfe vnto God, in ſome ſociety of religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which deſire ſhe did, not only afterward, not lay downe, but to the intent ſhe might be made partaker therof, ſhe did inceſſantly adore &amp; inuocate Allmighty God. That her prayers were not in vaine, the ſucceſſe it ſelfe may giue vs to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſeeing that ſhe firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Mother to this ſonne, who afterward being ioyned to the Society of Ieſus, both lead, and finiſhed his life therin with ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſanctity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:17839:21"/>
Neither truly ought it to ſeeme ſtrange to any one, that a ſonne of ſo great ſanctity, &amp; with ſo holy an intention deſired, ſhould be giuen by God at the requeſt of his Mother. For often we read, in the liues and actes of Saints, that God hath concurred with ſuch like deſires. As namely when at the ſuite of <hi>Anna,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, (who was before voyd of all iſſue) he gaue a ſonne, who afterward might be deuoted to his God-head. The ſame we read of <hi>S. Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Tolentine,</hi> who in lyke manner was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at the ſupplication of his barraine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Likewiſe of <hi>S. Francis</hi> of <hi>Paula,</hi> who in himſelfe, made both his fruitleſſe parents partakers of their deſires: and ſo of others. Verily I am of this opinion, that the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame God who ſuggeſted to the mind of this Noble Lady to beg of him this boone, was both willing, according to his accuſtomed clemency, to be preuailed withall, &amp; to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge likewiſe as his proper due, this her firſt fruite. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable vnto this, it ſeemeth that it was the pleaſure of Allmighty God to make Bleſſ. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> firſt his, before he had fully iſſued out of his Mothers wombe: for nether came it to paſſe without the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall conſent, and prouidence of Allmighty God, that when he was not yet wholy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered into this world, he ſhould be waſhed with Baptiſme, &amp; that alſo the moſt Bleſſed Virgin Queene of Heauen, to whome euen from his child-hood he was ſo much deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17839:21"/>
out of her eſpeciall fauour towards him ſhould be aſſiſting at his birth. For the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques his wife herſelf was wont to recount it in this manner, that when ſhe drew neare to the time of her child-birth, ſhe was vpon the ſuddaine oppreſſed with ſuch ſharpe paines, that voyd of all hope of deliuery, ſhe ſeemed to be brought to the laſt period of her life; when the Marques ſending for diuers Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, gaue them in charge, that if they were diffident of the life of the child, they ſhould at leaſt by baptiſme beſtow eternall ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on it, and endeauour to preſerue the life of the mother. They hauing in vaine attempted all arts and remedies, for the facilitating of the birth, gaue ouer the ſafety both of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and child, as deſperate and forelorne. This when the mother vnderſtood, in the middeſt of all deſpaire of humane helpe, determined to flie for refuge vnto God, &amp; his Virgin-mother. Therfore ſending for her husband into the Chamber, ſhe deſireth him to giue her leaue in this extremity, to make a vow vnto the Virgin-mother: when he had giuen his conſent, ſhe voweth, that if ſhe eſcape this danger, ſhe would go in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to our Ladies Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> together with her little Infant if life befell it. Her vow being made, ſhe ſeemeth to be out of all preſent danger, and beginneth to yield birth to the childe. Yet ſeing that it appeared vnto the Phiſitians that ſhe could not eſcape death, and the Marques inſiſted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17839:22"/>
vpon it earneſtly, that they ſhould at leaſt prouide for the ſafety of the childs ſoule, the mid-wife ſo ſoone as ſhe perceaued the child ſo far forth diſcouered, as that it might be capable of Baptiſme, falls firſt to chriſtning it, before it was wholy deliuered. So the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of them both were ſaued, &amp; in the child the grace of God, and that better, &amp; Diuine birth, out-ſtript this mortal one, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſingular fauour of God, who would appropriate him to himſelfe, from the very bowells of his mother, with a ſtrict kind of vaſallage. In which reſpect he was twin-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Mechtildes</hi> that holy Virgin, as it is written in her life, Almighty God declaring, that it was his pleaſure, that to the intent he might at the very firſt ſanctify her ſoule, as a temple to himſelfe, and preuent it with his grace from the very firſt inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of her birth, in feare of like danger her Baptiſme ſhould be haſtened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> was borne in the caſtle of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilion,</hi> which is the head of that Territory in which his Fathers dominion is placed, in the Dioceſſe of <hi>Breſcia, Pius V.</hi> being Pope, the yeare from Chriſts Natiuity 1568. the ſeauenth of the Ides of March (to wit, the ninth of the moneth) vpon a Tueſday, three quarters of an houre after the three &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith, which is about ſun-ſet. The mother pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently takes him into her armes, ſignes him with the ſigne of the croſſe, &amp; beſtoweth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a thouſand happy welcomes. After this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17839:22"/>
for the ſpace of an houre, he lay ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mouing, that no one could diſcerne whether he were liuing or dead. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hauing giuen but one only crye, he from that time forward reſted, &amp; tempered thoſe babiſh cries, vnto which other infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, for the moſt part, are ſo much inclined. And I belieue, that this was a preſage of the mildeneſſe of mind, and ſuauity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, which he ſhewed in the whole courſe of his life afterward. In the ſame year vpon 12. of the Kalends of May, and in like manner vpon a Tueſday, in the Church of the Saints <hi>Nazarius</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> he was by <hi>Iohn Baptista Pastorius</hi> Archprieſt of <hi>Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> with as much pompe as might be, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with the ſacred rites which are wont to be vſed in Baptiſme, and in memory of his Fathers Grandfather was called <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> or (which is all one) <hi>Lewis.</hi> He had God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father <hi>VVilliam</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who ſent <hi>Proſperus Gonzaga</hi> (a very Noble Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and kinſman to the Marques) who might ſupply his place by proxy at the Chriſtning. It was entred into the Tables of the curate of that Church; in which I obſerued, that whereas the chriſtnings of others of the ſame age, are rehearſed in Italian, to this his name alone (whether it was as an attribute to his noble deſcent, or that it fell out by ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inſtinct) there were adioyned certaine latin wordes, ſuch as are not added to any of his brothers, and the euent it ſelfe doth

               <p>NOw, with what care and induſtry he was bred vp from his very childhood, it may eaſily be gathered by this, for ſo much as he being the head of his houſe, was travned vp, not only in hope of his Fathers inheritance, but of two vneles likewiſe, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> who was Lord ouer <hi>Castle Godfrey,</hi> and of <hi>Horatius</hi> alſo, Lord of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurino.</hi> For wheras they held their liuing by Fee farme from the Emperour, and the one of them had none, the other no Male iſſue, their eſtates were of neceſſity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolue to <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> as heyre generall, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to them both. It was the ſpeciall care of the mother, as ſhe was herſelf of ſingular piety, that her ſonne ſhould be inured from a very little one, to haue God and his Saints in great reuerence. Therfore when he could ſcarcely ſpeake, ſhe wold reach him to make the ſigne of the croſſe, to prononce the moſt holy names of Ies vs and Maria, to learn
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17839:23"/>
without-booke our Lords Prayer, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall ſalutation, and other prayers. And ſhe commaunded the nurſe, and others who were imployed about him eyther for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, or ſolace, alſo to do the like. By which meanes he conceaued ſo much reuerence &amp; feare towards Almighty God, that euen by the cleare dawning of this his morning, we might preſage what the future ſplendour of his noone-tyde would be. This in like-ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did the mayds teſtify (who when at ſuch tyme, as they attended vpon the mother, had alſo in charge to dreſſe and vndreſſe the child) that they found in him, being but then an infant, a ſingular, and religious feare of God. They recount two things very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of memory, to be noted euen then in his diſpoſition. The one was, that in ſeeing the need of poore people, he was moued with mercy to ſhew himſelfe boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull towards them. The other was, that as ſoone as he could with-draw himſelfe to his home, he vſed often to hide himſelf in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and after long ſearch they ſhould find him in ſome ſolitary place cloſe at his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. By which circumſtance they gaue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture euen then what the future ſanctity of his life would be. Neyther want there thoſe that affirme vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oath, that they by the only imbracing of him, haue from thence-forth beene affected with ſuch an intrinſecal ſenſe of Piety, as if they had entertayned into their armes, ſome celeſtiall Angell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:17839:24"/>
This his loue, &amp; affection towards God, and celeſtiall thinges dayly increaſing, did very much delight his Mother. But his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being a Martialiſt, who had vndergone many martiall affayres vnder the Catholike King, did rather deſire to haue him inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in his artes. Wherfore he being not as yet aboue foure yeares of age, he prouideth for him little dagges, gunnes, and ſuch other ſmall weapons appropriated to that age. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto this, when by the deſignes of the ſame King, being to lead vnder his enſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes three thouſand <hi>Italian</hi> foot to <hi>Tunis,</hi> he muſtered them in the field of <hi>Cremona,</hi> at the Greater <hi>Caſsall,</hi> which is a towne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Dukedome of <hi>Millane,</hi> he tooke him thither with him, being but a child taken out of the womens hands, and the tuition of his mother, when he was not paſſing foure or fiue yeares of age. There thoſe dayes that the Companyes were muſtered, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds him to go before the ranckes, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a light Brigantine, and carrying vpon his ſhoulder a little ſpeare, after a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary manner. And he was merueilouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, when he ſaw the boy delighted in this kind of exerciſe. He hauing ſtayed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne moneths at <hi>Caſsall,</hi> as that age is apt to imitate all things which it ſees done, whilſt he dayly playeth, and talketh with the ſouldiers promiſcuouſly, by little and little he takes vnto him military affections, and he ſhewed by very pregna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſignes to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17839:24"/>
affectionately carrryed towards that glory, whither his Fathers incouragement, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample called him. The refore it often fell out, that medling both with other weapons, and eſpecially with peeces of ordinance, he did much indanger himſelfe, had not God who reſerued him to a more holy kind of life, in a manner aboue the courſe of nature diuerted him. Surely of this a teſtimony was giuen, when once in ſhooting off a ſmall gunne, he fouly beſmeared all his face with the hoat-burning ſteame of the powder.</p>
               <p>Another tyme, when in the ſummer the Marques about noone-tyde tooke his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, &amp; he (which you would wonder at in one of ſo ſmall age) hauing no ones helpe thereunto, caſting certaine powder which he had gathered out of the ſouldiers purſes whilſt they tooke their none-ſleepe, into a litle peece of ordinance, which ſtood before the Caſtle-walls, and putting fire therto, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped very narrowly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being ouerthrown with the violent recoyling of the carriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheeles flying backward. The Marques be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rouſed with the ſuddaine noiſe, fearing leaſt ſome mutiny had byn riſen amongſt the ſouldiers, ſent one to diſcouer what vnwonted inſolency this was. When he had vnderſtood the whole matter, he would haue corrected his ſonne, had not the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers (who were very much delighted with the great-vndertaking ſpirit of the child) begged his pardon. Theſe and other preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17839:25"/>
of the like kind, he was wont after when he liued amongſt religious perſons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to recount, as teſtimonies of the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar goodneſſe of Almighty God towardes him, by whoſe aſſiſtance he had eſcaped ſo great dangers. Neyther as then was he quite voyd of ſcruple for that litle powder which he had ſo purloyned from the Souldiers, had he not extenuated it with that comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table opinion, that the Souldiers would moſt willingly haue beſtowed it vpon him, if he had asked it of them.</p>
               <p>The Marques being to go with his forces to <hi>Tunis,</hi> ſendeth back <hi>Aloyſius</hi> to <hi>Castilion,</hi> where he continued the ſame courſe of lyfe which he vndertooke at <hi>Caſsall.</hi> And as for the moſt part, theſe common ſouldiers are giuen to licentious, and diſhoneſt ſpeaches, he likewiſe by conſorting with them had learned ſome ſuch like kind of talke, which he not knowing the meaning thereof did ſometymes vtter; as afterward he gaue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to <hi>F. Hierome Platus,</hi> when he inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him his whole courſe of life which he lead in the world, being now conſecrated to Religion. This, when vpon a certaine tyme <hi>Peter-Francis Turctus</hi> had vnderſtanding of, (who as we haue ſaid before was Tutour to him in his childhood) he did ſo vehemently inueigh agaynſt it, that as the ſelfe ſame Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour after affirmed vnto me, he neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was obſerued to vtter any other, then honeſt and decent ſpeaches. Yea, and more
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17839:25"/>
then that, when afterward he heard any one ſpeaking debauſly, he would ſtraight way with a modeſt cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, with his eyes caſt downe to the ground, or turned ſome other way, eyther ſeeme to diuert his mynd, or ſignify that the words were troubleſome to him to heare. Wherby we may vnderſtand, that he would neuer haue vſed theſe kind of ſpeaches, if he had firſt knowne what their meaning had beene. But in the whole courſe of <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his life, I find no ſinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, which was more culpable, then were theſe wordes pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by him being a very child, and ignorant what the things ſignifyed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be. Which ſo ſoone as he vnderſtood that they were vitious, and diſgracefull to his degree &amp; calling, ſo great a ſhamefaſtnes ceaſed vpon him, (as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward acknowledged) that he could ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely perſuade himſelfe to vnfould them to the Prieſt that was inquiſitour of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Neyther truly did the penitency of this fault which ſeemed ſo great vnto him, euer forſake him during his life. And as he had committed nothing worſe, that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience accuſed him of, ſo after he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Religion, to the intent that for the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming and vilifying of himſelfe, he might ſhew himſelfe guilty of frailty from his very child-hood, he would often recount to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his familiar friendes, theſe kind of paſſages. It is not vnlike, that God vpon ſet purpoſe ſuffered this kind of blemiſh to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17839:26"/>
ſtick cloſe by him, that whilſt he thought that to be a fault in himſelfe, which in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the ignorance of his childiſh age, and of the thing it ſelfe, is more probable was none, in the middeſt of ſo many heauenly guifts, and vertues with the which his mind was afterward enriched from God, he might haue ſome matter of humiliation; and that, as <hi>S.

now from the firſt tyme that he began to haue the vſe of reaſon, Almighty God did eyther preuent, or ſecond all his endeauours may be manifeſt heerby, in ſo much as foure Prieſts, who in diuers places, and at diuers tymes tooke his Confeſsions, euen thoſe which contained the diſcouery of his whole life, both before and after his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Society, and amongſt theſe <hi>Robert Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> that moſt illuſtrious Cardinall, who at his death heard the confeſsion of his whole life, all of them, allthough ignorant of ech others teſtimony, did with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſet downe in writing, that he neuer committed ſo much as one deadly ſinne, or loſt the grace of God which he obtayned in Baptiſme. The which thing is ſo much the more to be admired, for that he paſſed the moſt vnſtable part of his age, not in Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and ſacred Cloiſters of Religious men, in which, in reſpect of the ſmall occaſions of ſinne, or the ſupply of ſo great company of men deuoted to God, both for holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation and the help of ones mind, it is a great deale eaſier to preſerue the grace of God, then in a vulgar courſe of liberty; but he euen from his very cradle beganne to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe in Princes courts. For beſides that time in which he was borne &amp; bred vp in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, he ſpent many yeares after with the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> being alwayes ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly tyed to the neere conuerſation of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17839:27"/>
and great Noble-men, and to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuous commerce of all men of what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoeuer, as occaſion ſerued. And yet in the middeſt of the delicacies of his fathers houſe, and the prouocations of the Court, he preſerued that integrity of lyfe, which he put on as a white garment in his Baptiſme, pure from all blemiſh and vnſpotted. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt worthily did <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> vpon a certaine time, when in a ſpeach which he had with me, and diuers others, of the ſingular vertues of <hi>Aloyſius</hi> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then liuing, by many arguments teach, that there neuer wanted in this our Church (although di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed with a doubtfull conflict) certaine men of excellent ſanctity of life, who euen whilſt they liued, were confirmd in a ſtedfaſt degree of grace, in the ſight of Allmighty God, &amp; namely adioyned theſe wordes: <hi>In horum numero, quitam arcta at<expan>

Furthermore the ſame Cardinall in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable teſtimony authentically ſigned &amp; ſealed, added another certaine thing, which with thoſe that are not altogether ignorant of the leading of a holy &amp; retired courſe of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17839:27"/>
life, and that do prize the authority of this witneſſe, will moue far greater admiration. For he affirmeth that <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> euen from the very ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th yeare of his age, led a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect courſe of life, euery way accompliſhed with the exact rules of ſanctity. The dignity of which prerogatiue I leaue to the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wiſe.</p>
               <p>And it ſeemeth to haue bene the pleaſure of allmighty God, that euen the wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits themſelues, ſhould proclaime his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conuerſation, and the glory allready prepared for him in Heauen, when he was but yet a child. For when as a certaine reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, of that order of <hi>S. Francis</hi> which they call Friars Obſeruants, being of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fame wherſoeuer he trauailed, comming to <hi>Caſtilion,</hi> reſted in a Monaſtery of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der called <hi>S. Maries,</hi> one mile from the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, there was made great recourſe vnto him to ſee him, and requeſt his prayers. And for ſo much, as the report went that he did ſome thinges aboue humane power, many poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and vexed with diuels were brought to him, that they might be helped by his exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes. There, when this prieſt, in the ſight of a great aſſembly of people, together with diuers noble-men, and amongſt theſe, the child <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> and his other younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to his cuſtome caſt forth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe execratios againſt the diuel; thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirits cry out with a loud voyce, and with a hand ſtretched forth towards <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17839:28"/>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ideti ſne illum? hie demum eſt, quem celum &amp; multa inibi manet gloria.</hi> Do you ſee that boy? he it is for whome heauen at the laſt, &amp; much glory there, is prouided. That voyce was carried in memory &amp; diuulged throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Castilion.</hi> Neither are there wanting thoſe at this day, who teſtify that they were preſent at the hearing of that ſpeach. And although there be no credit to be giuen to the words of Diuells who are the Fathers of lyes, notwithſtanding I could eaſily be perſwaded, that they, to the intent they might be more aſhamed of their owne mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, were compelled by diuine force (as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at other times) to declare the truth.</p>
               <p>For ſo ſingular was the opinion of men, euen at that time of this holy young man, that in his life and manners, they did ſeeme to behould the forme of ſome Angell deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded from heauen. For daily at home vpon his knees he recited thoſe prayers that are called the Dayly Exerciſe, the ſeauen pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, the office of the Bleſſed Virgin, either alone, or togeather with ſome other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and performed other offices of piety. He was ſo accuſtomed in that ſort to kneele vpon the bare ground at his prayers, that he would not ſuffer a cuſhion, or any ſuch like thing to be put vnder his knees; &amp; this afterward did he ſolemnly obſerue in the whole courſe of his life, as I shall after declare.</p>
               <p>About that time he was vehemently ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17839:28"/>
with a Quartane Feuer, for the ſpace of eighteene whole moneths, although, becauſe at the firſt it was more extreme, afterward it held him leſſe in his bed. In the meane while he patiently endured this infirmity, neither did he euer omit, but that he would daily ſay the Graduall, &amp; the penitentiall Pſalmes &amp; other ſet-prayers. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when as he was more weake then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, he ſent for ſome of the maides that waited vpon his Mother, that ſo they might help to ſay with him for his eaſe. Theſe are the foundations which the <hi>B.

But he being now eight yeares of age, had far different deſignes in his mind, &amp; had taken vnto him thoughts of a certaine hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her degree of vertue. Neither did he doubt vpon a certaine time to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> known vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mother, whom whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had often heard ſay, that if ſhe ſhold be bleſſed with diuers children, it wold be a moſt acceptable thing vnto her, to ſee ſome one of them addicted to religion, he in ſecret ſpeaketh vnto her in this manner: Mother, ſayth he, you haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that it would be a thing acceptable vnto you, if you might haue ſome one of your ſonnes, who might ſort himſelfe in ſome religious family: ſurely I am confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that God will reward you for this gratious diſpoſition.

And eſpecially he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in his mind ſo much obſeruance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lady, the moſt B.

For they vpon whome he relyed as ghoſtly fathers, &amp; namely <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> in that teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which he confirmed by oath, and much more at large <hi>Hieronymus Platus</hi> in thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers written in latin, do affirme, that both the body of <hi>Aloyſius</hi> whilſt he liued, was free from all ſenſe and motion of luſt, and

               <p>Which thing being beyond the compaſſe of all humane ſtrength and induſtry, it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appeareth to haue beene giuen by God as a certaine peculiar guift, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of his moſt Deare Mother; which of how high a nature it is, he may eſtimate, who ſhall call to mind, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſpake of himſelfe or ſome other) did thrice beſeech our Lord that he would take from him, the ſtinge of the fleſh: That <hi>S.

Bernard</hi> plunging himſelfe vp to the neck in an yey poole extingniſhed this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous ardour: That certayne few Saints which almighty God pleaſed to endow with this ſingular guift, haue obtained a reſcue from this tyranny. And if there haue bene any, they haue arriued vnto it by daily prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and teares. Such did <hi>S.

To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>S. Thomas</hi> a man neerer to our memory, who obtayned the name of <hi>Angelicall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour,</hi> when he had with a burning fire-bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d driuen from him a certain laſciuious woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that an Angell afterward had girded him with a certayne girdle, was himſelfe alſo made partaker of this truly Angelicall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
               <p>Neyther was it out of any naturall frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, or ſtupidneſſe of ſenſes that <hi>B.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of his affayres. Let vs therfore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it to haue bene a diuine, and vnuſuall guift, proceeding from the ſingular fauour of the Virgin mother of God towards him, whom from that tyme forward in the whole courſe of his life he entertayned for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17839:32"/>
with a certaine tender kind of loue, and piety, and repoſed in her a great hope in the proſecution of all his affaires. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſingular vigilancy which himſelfe vſed in the ſeuere moderation of his ſenſes, was of no ſmall moment for the maintaining of this ſo excellent a benefit. For although nothing of this kind did very much trouble him, notwithſtanding out of his loue of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and holy chaſtity, he began euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that day to ſtand vpon his guard euer more, and to ſuruey, &amp; obſerue all his ſenſes with a certayne exquiſite care: And eſpecially, to reſtraine his eyes alwayes from all vicious allurements, and chiefly for that cauſe to go in publike with them continually fixed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: but he did ſo much, throughout the whole courſe of his life, auoyd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, and company of women where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he conuerſed, that you would thinke he had with them a kind of naturall antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.

               <p>At <hi>Castilion</hi> he receaued his mothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds, and returned an anſwere in very few wordes, to thoſe Noble women which ſometimes ſhe ſent from her company to his chamber to deliuer ſome meſſage vnto him, and he would talke with them no otherwiſe then through the doore halfe ſhut, with his eyes caſt vpon the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, leaſt he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould them. But that is not a thing much to be marueyled at; For he would not ſo much
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17839:33"/>
as indure to ſpeake to his mother her ſelfe, without witneſſes. Therfore if at any tyme, whilſt he was conuerſant with her, in the Chamber, or in the Parlour, others in the meane while ſhould chaunce to with-draw theſelues, he would likewiſe preſently take ſome occaſion to depart, and if he found none, he would bluſh with a modeſt kind of baſhfullneſſe. So ſingular was his ſolicitude and carefulneſſe. He being asked vpon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne tyme, by a certaine learned man who obſerued it, why he had this auerſion from behoulding any woman, and euen his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herſelfe? leaſt he ſhould make knowne his vertue, he rather aſcribed it to his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall baſhfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides other things which were agreed on betweene him &amp; his father this was one; that he ſhould commaund him in all things, but only in the viſits of women. That in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things he would be, as is duty was, at his diſpoſing. Therefore the Marques after that he perceaued him ſo conſtant in this purpoſe, not to trouble him, he was allwais obſeruing to his will heerin. He himſelfe in like manner would affirme, that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beheld certayne noble women who were very neere of kin vnto him. And this his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was ſo well knowne, that in ieſt he was oftentymes by his familiar friends cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Women-hater.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. At Florence he maketh great progreſſe in a more holy courſe of life.</head>
               <p>MOREOVER, when he was at <hi>Florence</hi> he began more often to purge his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by cofeſſion, then he had as yet done at <hi>Castilion,</hi> with a certaine prieſt of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of IESVS, deſigned vnto him by his Gouernor, who at that time gouerned the college in that Citty. When he came firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to confeſſion, hauing much and long before, both meditated and prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at home, he conceaued in the preſence of him ſo much reuerence, baſhfulneſſe, and ſubmiſſion of himſelfe, as if he had exceeded all mortall men in the multitude of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. He is ſcarcely kneeled at his feet, but he falls into a ſound, and of neceſſity being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp by his gouernor is carried home. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward returning thither he diſcouered all the ſinnes of his life paſt: of which thing we haue often heard him recount, after he was ioyned to the Company of religious men, that he reſted ſatisfied in that confeſſion which he made at <hi>Florence</hi> of his whole life. For ſo much as this was the beginning of knowing himſelfe, and vndertaking the courſe of a more ſtrict kind of life. For then he began carefully to diſcuſſe euery one of his actions, &amp; if he found any imperfection therin, he would wholy imploy himſelfe, in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17839:34"/>
ſearching out, &amp; pulling vp the very rootes therof. Firſt of al therfore he obſerued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to be ſomewhat of a cholerick nature, to be ſometimes eaſily tranſported with a certaine kind of ſtomake, which though it did not breake forth, notwithſtanding it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed his mind with ſome griefe and indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. He gaue himſelfe therfore to conſider of the foule deformity of anger, which he ſaid, did manifeſtly appeare and diſcouer it ſelfe, when the mind being recalled to his former tranquility, he might perceaue that a man whilſt he was poſſeſſed with anger, was in ſome ſort beſides his ſenſes. When he had diſcouered that, he determined in time, to come to bend himſelfe to the repreſſing &amp; ſupplanting of that corrupt diſpoſition of his mind. At the laſt, by the aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God and his owne great induſtry, he did ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ouercome it, that he ſeemed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be voyd of all motion of anger.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he perceaued that oftenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in company, ſome one word or other fell from him that might tend to the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of others. And allthough, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe afterward confeſſed, of what quality ſoeuer that ſinne was, it was ſcarcely at any time ſo great, that it might be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe, which for their ſlenderneſſe are accounted veniall; notwithſtanding for this cauſe he was diſpleaſed with himſelfe, &amp; to the intent that he might not any more be compelled to accuſe himſelfe, of any ſuch
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17839:34"/>
like fault to the Prieſt, he did eſchew the company and diſcourſe, not only of other friends, but euen of thoſe which were moſt familiar vnto him, and began very much to addict himſelfe to retirement and ſolitude, where he might neither ſpeake, nor heare any thing that might caſt vpon his conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce any the leaſt ſpot. Some did aſcribe that to-too much ſcrupuloſity and ſeuerity: But he doubtleſſe made but ſmall account of what others thought. And from that time, all the courſe of his life after, he did perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually abſtaine from all kind of ſport. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore he was ſo much affected to the obedience of his ſuperiours, that his Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor denied, that euer he omitted any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of his, how little ſoeuer it was. And which is more, if at any time he ſaw his yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother <hi>Rodulph</hi> take in ill part the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his maiſter, either of manners or learning, he would with a check exhort him to ſubmit himſelfe to gouernement.</p>
               <p>He had ſuch reſpect ouer his ſeruants, &amp; in ſuch ſort commaunded them, that he made them aſhamed not to obey him. For ſo much as they deny, that euer he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them imperiouſly, but euen in theſe formes of ſpeach: <hi>Niſi tibi molestum est, licet hoc facias: ſi tibi commodum est, hoc abs te velim: Amabo te, hoc mihi effectum da.</hi> That is to ſay: If it be not trobleſome vnto you, you may do this: if co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly you may, this would I haue you doe: I pray thee diſpatch this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17839:35"/>
for me. Which when he ſaid, there euer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo much ſweetneſſe in him, that he ſhewed himſelfe much to be moued with commiſeration ouer his ſeruants. By this behauiour he did much oblige the mindes of them vnto him.</p>
               <p>He was of ſo ſingular modeſty, that he bluſhed in euen behoulding his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berlaine whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he apparelled him in the morning, and in putting on his breeches, he would ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely thruſt his toes out of the bed-cloathes, ſo fearful he was to diſcouer any naked part. He was preſent euery day at Maſſe, and vpon feſtiuall dayes at Euenſong. All that time he had knowne nothing as yet of the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meditation of celeſtiall thinges, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelfe only to the reciting of his vocall prayers. Therfore euery morning by breake of day, he recited thoſe which are contained in the daily Exerciſe, &amp; the other which I ſpake of before, humbly and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely. Notwithſtanding allthough in very deed he had not as then determined in his mind to abandone all the goods of Fortune, neuertheleſſe he was fully reſolued, that if he did retaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he would be take himſelfe to a moſt innocent, and exact courſe of life.</p>
               <p>And with this grauity of manners was <hi>B.

               <p>BLESSED <hi>Aloyſius</hi> had now liued at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> for two yeares, when by his father (vnto whome <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> had then giuen the gouernment of <hi>Monte-Ferrato)</hi> he was commanded togeather with <hi>Rodulph</hi> his yonger brother to liue at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tua.</hi> Thither therfore, by the great Dukes good leaue, he betooke himſelfe, in the moneth of Nouember the yeare 1579. when he was 11. years of age, and 8. moneths. There whilſt he proſecuteth his cuſtome, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at <hi>Florence</hi> of exerciſing a pious life, with no leſſe graue aduiſe then he had before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun it, he determineth to renounce the tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le and commodities of the Marques of <hi>Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> with the which he was now by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall authority adorned, and to reſigne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer to <hi>Rodulphus</hi> his yonger brother. And although he did now of late certainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to abſtaine from mariage, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at that time, his indiſpoſition of health, by reaſon of the ſtraightneſſe of his water, gaue no ſmall confirmation to this his new reſolution. For when he feared leaſt that malady ſhould increaſe, it ſeemed good vnto him by the aduiſe of the Phiſitians to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to conſume thoſe bad humours by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17839:36"/>
which were the matter of his diſeaſe: vnto which abſtinence he gaue himſelf with ſo much rigour, that it is ſtrange, how he could eſcape death. For if ſometimes at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he did eate but one whole egge (which ſeldome tymes he did) then he ſeemed to himſelfe to haue feaſted very royally.</p>
               <p>This ſeuere abſtinence he obſerued, both all that winter which he remained at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> and all the ſumer following at <hi>Castilion,</hi> though diſſuaded now by the Phiſitians &amp; all others, not ſo much for his health, as it was generally thought, but (as he, after he was adioyned to the religious Society con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to <hi>Hierome Platus)</hi> for deuotion ſake. For although the loue of his health did at the firſt driue him to that ſo rigid a courſe of dyet, by degrees notwithſtanding he turned it into a cuſtome, and out of that loue which he bare to Almighty God, it began to be a pleaſure to him. But as it preuayled in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing away that diſeaſe which was growing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him (as one who al his life after was free from it,) ſo did it very much impayre the whole ſtate of his health otherwiſe, for with that ſlenderneſſe of dyet he did ſo far forth weaken his ſtomacke, that afterward when he moſt would, he could not take meate, &amp; if agaynſt his appetite he tooke it, could he by any meanes retaine it. Therfore wheras hertofore he had beene ſomwhat corpulent, he was always afterward of a leane habit of body: moreouer his former ſtrength being
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17839:36"/>
decayed, in place of that naturall vigour there ſucceeded a very great weakeneſſe that vtterly corrupted the whole ſtate of his body, which notwithſtanding brought this fruite to his mind, that for this reſpect he was deſtitute of many ſportes which if he had bene of entire health he could not haue auoyded.</p>
               <p>Therfore he did ſeldome go forth in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike, vnleſſe he went to ſome Church, or religious houſe, where he did ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcourſe of celeſtiall things. It fell out alſo once whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went to ſee <hi>Proſperus Gonzaga</hi> his Coſen, and a prime man, that in the entrance of his houſe, going into a priuate <hi>Chappell,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelfe for a certaine time to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions, but afterward he ſo diſcourſed with him, and with the reſt of his familiar frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, with ſo much feruour, and ſubtility of diuine thinges, that euen then all of them eſteemed him to be a holy man. The reſt of his time for the moſt part he ſpent alone and at home, ſequeſtred from the company of men, ſometimes reading thoſe hiſtories of <hi>Saints</hi> which <hi>Surius</hi> collected, with which he was very much delighted, ſometimes reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ſet-prayers, &amp; in frequenting other actes of piety. The which actes he did ſo daily increaſe, that wheras out of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to that quiet kind of life, he grew by little and little weary of all humane conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, he at laſt determined, that yielding vp the honors, and riches of Marques to his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17839:37"/>
brother <hi>Rodulph,</hi> he would deuote himſelfe to the Church; not out of any hope to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Honours therein (which, being by many often offered him, he had alwais moſt conſtantly refuſed) but for that he might in that kind of life beſtow himſelfe wholy, more frely &amp; quietly in the ſeruice of God. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had determined this in his mind, he began earneſtly to importune the Marques that he wold giue him leaue, being diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of Court imployments, to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto the ſtudy of learning.

by that cure which his mother would haue applied to him, he might haue bene wholy recouered, if he could haue perſwaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to haue remitted any thing of that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of life: vnto which he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at <hi>Mantua.</hi> But he doubtleſſe being more ſolicitous of the health of his mind, then of his body, was ſo far from any relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe endeauours of piety, vnto which he had accuſtomed himſelfe, as that he did rather ſtraighten them. For he added vnto that ſtrictneſſe of diet which he had impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon himſelfe, with great rigour, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſolitarines, in which he ſhrowded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the loue of diuine thinges, auoiding all humane ſociety.</p>
               <p>Wheras therfore he daily ſeparated, and eſtranged himſelf from the common ſort of men, who are only drawne with theſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall reſpectes; God according to his ſingular goodneſſe in rewarding thoſe who fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerue him, did vouchſafe to declare, how gratefully he accepted this mynd, ſo pious and ſo deſirous of his honour, with which a youth but of twelue yeares of age did with ſo much innocency of manners co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate himſelfe vnto him. Therfore for ſo much as to that very day he was inſtructed by no man, of the manner of meditating v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon celeſtiall matters, nor had any vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; it was the pleaſure of God that without humane help, he would himſelfe inſtructe him with his owne inſpiration. For hauing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17839:38"/>
once moſt fitly prepared his mind, in reſpect of the excellent purity therof, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing of heauenly riches, he brought him to the moſt hidden treaſures of his guiftes, and powred vpon him with a full hand (as they ſay) his endowments. For when as he had enlightned his mind with a certaine ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall light, which exceeded in clearneſſe all human capacity, he taught him a way of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, &amp; pondering vpon the Almighty power and greatneſſe of God, far more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and high, then it could haue bene done by the precepts of any mortall man. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perceaued, that this ſo eaſy an entrance as it were to the plentifull paſture, and cheerfull food of his ſoule, was ſo bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully laid ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him, by way of ſeruiceable gratitude, for this his loue ſhewed towards him; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained whole dayes traſported in thinking ſometimes of thoſe admirable things which fell out in the working of our ſaluation; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſometimes in meditating vpon the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and attributes of Almighty God, when in the meane while he was ſurpriſed with ſo great ioy, that he could by no meanes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate his teares. So as with them he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten moiſtned not only the garments which he wore, but euen the floor of his chamber. Therfore for the moſt part all the day he was cloſe ſhut vp, leaſt if he ſhold haue gone forth any whither, he might ether haue loſt that ſenſe of piety, or being found by any one to haue wept, might haue bene hindred
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17839:38"/>
from proſecuting the ſame. This when his ſeruants obſerued, they would often throgh the chinkes of the doore deſcry what he was doing. For oftentimes they ſaw him knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before a crucifix for diuers houres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with his eyes fixed vpon it, with his armes ſometimes ſtretched out, ſometimes placed before his breſt in the forme of a croſſe, when he ſhed ſo many tears, that the very ſobs &amp; grones might be heard throgh the doores. And ſometimes they perceaued him to remaine vnmooued, with his mind abſtracted from his ſenſes, euen like a ſtatue, with his eyes not ſo much as once caſt down. At which time his Gouernour, &amp; others that were of his chamber, do affirme, that he was therin ſo alienated from all ſenſe, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with paſſing through his chamber, nor with making any other noiſe, they could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert his mind. When the fame of theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had ſpred it ſelfe abroad, not now his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar acquaintance only, but they alſo who were none of the Court, being admitted to the ſame chinkes, and made eye-witneſſes of the ſame thinges, could neuer ſufficiently admire them. Oftentimes alſo did the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall ſeruitours heare him, in going vp the ſtaires, ſay vpon euery ſtaire an <hi>Ane Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> But now both at home, and abroad, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was carried in coach, or went on foot, he neuer caſt off his mind from the meditation of heauenly myſteries. In which exerciſe of piety, as I ſaid before, he made vſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17839:39"/>
of no Maiſter but the holy Ghoſt, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued his mind with this diuine guifte, as it were with a pretious ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And although he now obſerued a certaine manner of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, notwithſtanding he had not as yet learned to performe it in methode &amp; order, neither did he ſufficiently vnderſtand, what places he ſhould eſpecially chooſe for it. Therfore at that time he fitly light vpon a certayne little Booke of <hi>Peter Caniſius,</hi> a Deuine of the Society of IESVS, in which certaine heads of meditation, were after a certaine methodicall manner, ſet downe. Therby he was not only more vehemently enkindled towards the loue of Diuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, but alſo vnderſtood what courſe he ſhould inſiſt vpon in meditation, &amp; what times he ſhould obſerue. Although then truly he confined his meditations within no certaine limits of time, but according to the copiouſneſſe of the ſubiect, &amp; according as his mind was put on forward with diuine impulſions, he eyther made them longer or ſhorter: but in ſuch ſort as that he neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them, but eyther with his mind illuminated with new lightes from heauen, or with his will inflamed with new ardour, or with his whole hart ſteeped in new ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

               <p>HE was wont afterward to recount that this ſelfe-ſame litle Booke, of which I made mention, togeather with the Indian Epiſtles did very much win his mind to the Society of IESVS. The Booke truly, for that he ſayd, he did very much approue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the order of things therin, &amp; much more the ſpirit by the impulſion whereof it was written. And the Epiſtles, for that by them he vnderſtood how much God cooperated with the fathers of the Society of IESVS in reducing nations to Chriſt in thoſe climats. Therfore he ſtirred vp his mind to the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of theſe excellent enterpriſes for the ſauing of ſoules which coſt God ſo deare, though it ſhould be with the expenſe of his owne life.

He could in no ſort endure that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God ſhould be offended.</p>
               <p>He obſerued it as a ſolemne cuſtome, that he would intertaine no other diſcourſe but of diuine matters, &amp; that with ſo great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity of wordes and ſentences, that when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that tyme he went with his mother to <hi>Dertona,</hi> to ſalute the Duches of <hi>Loraine,</hi> a very noble Lady, who togeather with her daughter the Duches of <hi>Brunſwike</hi> tooke her iourney thither, he did with ſpeaking aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all that Princes pages.

               <p>THESE things were done in the yeare of our Saluation 1580. wherin <hi>Charles Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romeus,</hi> Cardinall and Archbiſhop of <hi>Milane,</hi> a man of excellent Sanctity, was by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth created Apoſtolicke Viſitour, ouer all thoſe Dioceſes which were in his prouince, and came to <hi>Castilion,</hi> whilſt he viſited the Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeauen men, which he had choſen out of all his retinue, leaſt he might become trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to the Eccleſiaſticall men which he came to viſit. Then, wheras he performed many other thinges, excellently, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an Apoſtolike ſpirit, he in like manner in the yeare aforeſaid, the 11. of the Calends of Auguſt, which is S. <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi> day, being veſted in his Pontificall ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, in the Church of the Saints <hi>Nazarius</hi> &amp; <hi>Celſus,</hi> which is the chiefe of that towne, made a very fruitfull ſermon to the people: and although the Princes ſending diuers meſſengers vnto him, did very much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune him, that he would be pleaſed to take his intertainement with them in the caſtle; notwithſtanding he could neuer be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to reſt in any place, otherwiſe then with the Archprieſt, whoſe houſe was neare adioining to that holy Church. When <hi>B. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius</hi> being now but of the age of 12. yeares,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17839:41"/>
and foure moneths, reſorted thither vnto him for the tendering of his duty, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible how much ioy he conceaued by the only behoulding of this child, being euen like one of the Bleſſed celeſtiall Angells, gratious in the ſight of God; &amp; he ſpent ſo much time with him, in long diſcourſes of Diuine matters priuately in his cloſet, that it moued great admiration to all them that waited before the doores. Queſtionleſſe it was an infinite contentment to this good Cardinall, to behould this tender plant, in the middeſt of the thornes of diuers ſecular Courts, without the induſtry of any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall husbandman, by the only inſpiration of heauenly breath, flouriſhing with ſo comely vigour, and brought vp to ſuch an height of Chriſtian vertue. The holy child in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner very much reioyced, that he had gotten a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto whome he might confidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelfe, and of whome he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt an explication of thoſe thinges which ſeemed obſcure in the purſuite of true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For wheras he had heard much of the ſanctity of this Cardinall, which was very much ſpoken of, he did earneſtly ingroſſe (as it were deliuered by the oracle of God) all his words and precepts which he deliuered, of the keeping, and following of a ſetled forme of huing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B. Charles</hi> asked of him, whether he had euer receaued the bleſſed Euchariſt or no: which whe hedenied, the Cardinall who had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17839:41"/>
now perceaued the integrity of his mind, &amp; his maturity of wiſedome, together with his vnderſtanding of heauenly matters drawne from God, did very ſeriouſly exhort him not only to receaue it, but alſo to freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it. Furthermore in a ſhort diſcours he ſet down vnto him an eaſy forme, both rightly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe, and piouſly to receaue this fountaine of all diuine bounty. Beſides this, he did ſeriouſly exhort him, that he ſhould often, and diligently peruſe the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, ſet forth by decree of the <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Councell, at the commaund of <hi>Pius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> the Pope, which booke in reſpect of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, this Cardinall did ſo much eſteeme of, that reiecting <hi>Cicero</hi> &amp; other profane <hi>Latin</hi> authors, he thought it only fit to be explicated to youths in the Schooles, to the intent that therby they might both reape piety, and a copious <hi>Latin</hi> tongue. Neither did he doubt to put this in practiſe in the <hi>Seminary</hi> at <hi>Millane.</hi> But when by vſe it ſelfe he found, that it fell not out according to his deſire, he did by commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as it were, reuiue the old authours againe. To conclude when he had giuen his benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> and had ſhewed other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of his great good will towards him, he gaue him leaue to depart.</p>
               <p>This Bleſſed child omitted not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to memory the admonitions of ſo holy a Cardinall. Therfore he began afterward with great contentment to peruſe that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17839:42"/>
both for that it was repleniſhed with excellent learning for all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and Chriſtian inſtructions; &amp; alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was inuited to the reading therof by the counſell of ſo excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a man, whome according as he well deſerued, he did with all dutifull reſpect honour. And likewiſe he was very importunate by the authority of ſo worthy a perſwader, to incite others to the reading of the ſame booke. He alſo began to enioy the diuine Euchariſt, to which before he came, it is incredible how diligent prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he vſed. For firſt of all leaſt he ſhould ſuffer any vnſeemely thing to reſt in his mind, which might be offenſiue to the eyes of God, whome he expected as a gueſt, verily he made a carefull &amp; exact diſcuſſion of the courſe of all his life paſt. Afterward he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to accuſe himſelfe to the Prieſt, whom he did edify with ſo excellent teſtimonies of a penitent and humble mind, witneſſed with his teares, that he ſeemed rather to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as a maiſter, then as a guilty perſon. And doubtleſſe, if he were culpable of any thing, that was nothing of fact, but of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only, as he ſuppoſed, of his duty. For wheras he perſuaded himſelfe that he neuer came, euen with that immortall light which God had ſet before his mind of aſpiring dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to higher degrees of vertue, queſtionles he ſeemed alwaies vnto himſelfe a loyterer and a truant. Furthermore, during all thoſe dayes, which went before the prefixed time
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17839:42"/>
of this his heauenly banquet, the memory of that only tooke place, both in his mind, and ſpeach. He made ſearch what others haue excellently written therof, he did with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe meditate therof, that he might be made partaker therof: he did daily ſo offer vp his prayers, that his familiar friends would ſay, that he ſeemed euen to expoſtulate with the very walls, ſo often did he, now in this, now in that corner of the houſe, ſet himſelfe downe vpon his knees to pray.</p>
               <p>But what the feruorous piety of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mind was, when he was firſt receaued to the diuine banquet, &amp; how much his will was inflamed with loue, was only knowne to God, who beheld the hidden ſecrets of his heart. Surely I could neuer find any mortall man, who was euer able to relate any thing of them vnto me. I only remember, that I haue read this one relation in his publike actes, that he in receauing the Euchariſt, had all the powers of his ſoule recollected, and very attentiue, that he was wont to be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with plentifull delicacies, and that he was openly a notable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of piety to all. Hauing taken this diuine repaſt, remaining vpon his knees in the ſight of all the people he continued in the holy Church. After that time he did not ceaſe often to receaue the holy communion.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this is a thing of very good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which I haue heard both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; from others who did often obſerue
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17839:43"/>
it; that truly from this time he had in ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great veneration the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that daily when he was preſent at holy Maſſe, after that the Prieſt had in expreſſe wordes conſecrated the body of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with infinite force of piety, diſſolued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to teares, he would moiſten the very grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnder him. In the ſame manner he ſtood affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, all the courſe of his life after, ſauing that only vpon feſtiuall dayes, when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was refreſhed with that ſacred ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet, he powred out teares more abundantly.</p>

                  </hi> towards <hi>Monte-Ferrato,</hi> wherin <hi>Aloyſius</hi> did vndergo a manifeſt danger of his life. For wheras the riuer <hi>Ticino</hi> being very much increaſed with often ſhewers, was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſity to be paſſed at one of the foar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, in the middeſt of the very ſtreame of the water, the coach wherin <hi>Aloyſius</hi> togeather with <hi>Rodulphus</hi> and their Gouernour went, was broken in the middeſt. The forepart thereof wherein <hi>Rodulphus</hi> was, being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the horſes, although not without ſome labour &amp; danger, was drawne by them, to the further bancke, whether the other coaches had now arriued: the hinder part, which carried <hi>Aloyſius</hi> and his Gouernour, being by the violence of the current carried far off, had brought both their liues into doubt, for whether the ſtreame had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, or ſwallowed it vp, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> muſt of neceſſity haue periſhed in the waters. But verily it was the pleaſure of God, according to the ſingular care which he had of this child, to prouide, that this part of the coach ſhould by a great trunke of a tree, which the

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing eſcaped this danger, aſſembling their company togeather, they went to the next holy Church, humbly to thanke Almighty God, by whoſe beneficiall fauour they had auoyded this ſo diſtreſſefull accident. In the meane time, the fame went that they were drowned. His mother being gone before in the formoſt coach, hearing this meſſage, full of griefe and feare, came backe a great part of the way. Furthermore this rumour had ſpred it ſelfe euen to <hi>Caſall,</hi> to the Marques his owne eares. He ſends away a man in poſt haſt to diſcouer the buſineſſe, neither after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tooke any reſt till he knew the truth of the matter. But ſhortly after, the arriuall of his wife and children disburthened him of all care and griefe.</p>

                  <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> remained at <hi>Caſall</hi> in <hi>Monte-Ferrato</hi> aboue halfe a yeare. During which time he both diligently applied himſelfe to the learning of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, wherin he profited indifferently well, and moreouer aduanced himſelfe further towards perfect vertue, by the moſt innocent and Saint-like conuerſation of thoſe holy Fathers, who

firſt tooke their denomination from <hi>S. Iohn Beheaded,</hi> or according to the more vulgar report, from <hi>S.

And as by his excellent indeauours he did euery day more then other deſerue at Gods handes new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments; ſo did he diſcloſe vnto his mind new lightes of eternall learning, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more with new inſtinct, as it were with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpurs driuing him away from tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thinges, excite him by degrees to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of greater, and greater ſanctity.</p>
               <p>Therfore although his Father endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to offer him diuers occaſions of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and delighting his mind, to the intent that he might remit ſomewhat of that his ſo earneſt purſuite of piety; notwithſtanding he neuer ſuffered himſelfe to be any whit at all withdrawne from that duty, which he had vndertaken towards God.

immortall riches, &amp; in theſe kind of gaines, which togeather with being infinitely meritorious in the ſight of God, do tye him eternatly vnto themſelues; neither haue they any cauſe to feare, that thoſe pious labours which they vndertake can euer be in vaine. To conclude, Religious men are they (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer elſe are) who in the leading of their life fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low reaſon as their guide; neither are they ſubiect to the dominion of ſenſuall deſires. They ſue for no honours, they make no eſteeme of terrene, &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory goods, they are not stirred vp with the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tementes of emulation, they gape not after any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens fortunes, being in that only ſeruice of God happy, whome to ſerue, is to raigne. And what wonder is it, I pray you, that they being allwaies quiet, and merry, feare neither death, nor the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of God, nor the punishmentes of hell, for ſo much as they haue their mindes guilty of no ſinne? VVhat wonder is it, that they day &amp; night store vp celestiall riches, ſeing that being neuer otherwiſe imployed then in actes of piety, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alwaies worke with God, or for God?

And what thing can be more ioyfull, then when they call to mind whome they ſerus, &amp; in whoſe band they lead their liues? But thou, what dost thou? what thinkest thou? what hindreth thee from chooſing this kind of life? See now at last in thy mind, what rewards are

If (according as thou hast determined) transferring the dignity of Marques vnto</hi> Rodulph, <hi>thou witt not depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, thou mayst perhaps ſee many thinges which thou cauſt not approue of.

                  <hi>But truly if thou imbrace a Religious courſe of life, thou shalt as it were with one stroke cut in ſunder all theſe bonds which hould thee.

No man notwithſtanding was ſo bould, as to aske him what his debatement was. To conclude, after he had often humbly petitioned Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, after he had refreſhed himſelfe often with the Bleſſed Euchariſt, that it would pleaſe him to vouchſafe him his light for the diſcuſſing of deliberations of that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17839:47"/>
conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; ſuppoſing this reſolution to be inſpired into him by God, bidding farewell to the world with all ſecular affaires, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be take himſelfe to ſome Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious family, where he would by vow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, beſides Virginity which before he had deuoted to Almighty God, alſo Obedience and Euangelicall pouerty. But for ſo much as hauing not as yet paſſed the thirteenth yeare of his age, it was not expedient for him to put his thoughts in execution; he neither aſſigned vnto himſelfe any family, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed vnto any one that which he had in his mind. But notwithſtanding, thoſe Fathers hauing diſcouering ſomewhat of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, became hopefull that he would at laſt adioyne himſelfe to their company.</p>
               <p>In the meane while, he, leaſt his manners might diſagree from the purpoſe of his mind, began more ſtrictly and vigilantly to order the whole courſe of his life, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſecular and Court-delicacies, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in all vertue, the conuerſation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men; to retire himſelfe longer to his chamber; not to haue any fire in the winter ſeaſon kindled, or brought into the ſame, where hitherto he was wont to haue ſome in reſpect of the tenderneſſe of his handes, which were accuſtomed to ſwell and breake with cold: in like manner abroad neuer to come neere the fire, and if for company of others it was requiſite to do otherwiſe, to take that place wherin he might be ſenſible
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17839:47"/>
of no warmeneſſe; to take with ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a gratefull mind, thoſe remedies which were brought him by thoſe of the houſe to allay the ſwelling of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, but ſetting them a ſide to make no vſe of them; to do all thinges out of a loue to ſuffer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity for Gods ſake.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he auoyded all concourſe of people, &amp; much more did he abhorre Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, late ſuppers, and delicious bankets, to which he was ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuited, but neuer cold be perſuaded by his Father ſometimes euen ſtomaking that his ſo vnuſuall deſire of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. Therfore others reſorting thither, he only remained at home, and there ſpent his time, ſometimes in holy meditations, ſometimes in communication of learning or piety, with one, or other graue and learned man. And other ſometimes he went to the <hi>Capuchin</hi> Fathers, and to the <hi>Barnabites;</hi> and wheras he could no more be carried away with the pompes, &amp; pleaſures of the world, he inioyed their holy diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>Vpon a certaine time, his Father tooke him in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany to <hi>Millane,</hi> that he might behould the tranſportation of all the horſes of that prouince, wherat it was requiſite that he for the diſcharg of a certaine office which he mannaged, ſhould togeather with many other principall men, be preſent. Wheras therfore, for ſo much as this was a thing rare and thought very well worthy the ſeeing, there reſorted a great concourſe of people
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17839:48"/>
vnto it. <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> who leaſt he ſhould incenſe his Father, commaunding this preciſely out of his authority, could do no otherwiſe but goe, yet made vſe of this new art, to wit, he neuer ſuffered himſelfe to be ſet in thoſe principall ſeates, from whence the whole pompe might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly haue byn ſeen: and which is more; as far forth as he might, he endeauoured, either ſtill to ſit with his eyes ſhut, or turned ſome other way.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I may very truly affirme, that he paſſed ouer his childhood, without euer playing the child. For he was neuer found in that age, to haue done any thing that might ſauour of leuity. He neuer hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any diſhoneſt, or vnprofitable bookes. He was much delighted to read the actes of <hi>Saints</hi> ſet downe by <hi>Surius,</hi> and <hi>Lippomanus.</hi> Of profane writers he for the moſt part read thoſe, who write of manners, as <hi>Seneca, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alerius Maximus.</hi> He made vſe of examples taken out of them, at ſuch time, as he exhorted others to frame the courſe of their life out of the preceptes of Chriſt, or <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> For he ſometimes vttered ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, either openly with diuers others, or priuately with ſome one alone, ſo repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with moſt wiſe ſentences, ſo elegant, ſo feruent, that all being aſtoniſhed, would ſay, that his doctrin did far ſurpaſſe the capacity of his age, and that it was therfore deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. That in like manner was the cauſe, why his kindred (whereas they were not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant

of his conditions, and beheld not without diſpleaſure, ſo much rigour of diet, and apparrell, and contempt of all thinges which the world commendeth, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>AFTER the Marques hauing perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his gouernment of <hi>Monte-Ferrato</hi> went backe with his whole family to <hi>Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Aloyſius</hi> was ſo far from any relaxation of that zeale of prayer, &amp; ſharp affliction of himſelfe, that he did ſo much more ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it. A great maruell it is therfore, that he either was not oppreſſed with ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous diſeaſe, which might vtterly haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne his health, now lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſince much impaired, or that his parentes in whoſe ſight he did theſe things, had not out of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority forbidden him. For to that ſpare &amp; hard diet, which (as I ſaid before) he vſed at <hi>Mantua,</hi> and neuer after left off, he added many other entire faſts, as namely he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued three ſet-faſts at the leaſt euery weeke; That is to ſay, vpon Saturday, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the moſt bleſſed Virgin-Mother; v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17839:49"/>
Friday, in memory of the paſſion of Chriſt our Sauiour, vpon which day being only contented with bred and water, in the morning with nothing elſe but three mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of bred dipped in water, and at euening for his hungry reſection, he liued vpon one only cutting of bread, a litle toſted, &amp; ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in water. To conclude, vpon wedneſday ſometimes he abſtained from all thinges, except bread and water; ſometimes he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the receaued cuſtome of faſting in the Church. There were added vnto theſe other extraordinary faſts, which of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord he impoſed vpon himſelfe, as often as either the time moued him therunto, or that he perceaued himſelfe drawne by the loue of God, and ardour of piety. Furthermore he was ſo moderate in eating, that ſome of his Fathers family maruelling, how he was able to maintaine his life, determined at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares to him, to waygh how much meate he tooke at one meale; &amp; after, that by bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance-waight they had examined his bread togeather with his meat, they affirmed by oath, that his vſuall dinner or ſupper, did not fully amount to one Ounce waight. Which waight is ſo far from ſupplying the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſity of nature, that we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily confeſſe that which we haue heard of other <hi>Saints,</hi> that his life was ſuſtained by ſome diuine aſſiſtance, without which it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth impoſſible to liue of ſo little meate.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it was euer his cuſtome, to caſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17839:49"/>
his eye vpon that which he thought to be the worſt diſh on the Table, and taſting a litle therof to leaue the reſt vntouched. But in the later ending of his time in a ſecular life, vpon thoſe dayes that he did not faſt, he would take no meat but by waight, ſaying that, that was inough to maintaine life, and that the ouerplus was to be refuſed as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. And theſe thinges that haue bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of the courſe of his diet, both others, and alſo he that was his cup-bearer, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and other of his Table-wayters deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vpon their oathes.</p>
               <p>He adioyned in like manner to this ſeuere abſtinence, other auſtere puniſhments which he inflicted vpon his body. Therfore euery weeke he diſciplined himſelfe three times at at leaſt: but in thoſe laſt yeares that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed in the world, he vſed it euery day, &amp; at laſt three tymes within the ſpace of the night and the day, till he imbrued himſelfe in his owne bloud. But for ſo much as at the firſt he wanted a whippe made for this vſe, he ſcourged himſelfe with ſuch kind of tho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues as they are wont to tye dogs in, which by chaunce he found about the houſe; or with the endes of ropes, or as ſome ſay, with an iron chayne. They who for obſeruance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake wayted before his doores, do witneſſe that they haue oftenſeene him kneeling v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his knees and ſcourging himſelf. In like manner when they made his bed, they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hidden vnder his bolſter certaine ſcourges
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17839:50"/>
made of whip-cordes, with which he vſed to diſcipline himſelfe. Moreouer his ſhirtes were often ſhewed to his mother all beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meared with bloud which followed the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of the laſhes. The Marques being certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of theſe thinges, did both at other times often inueigh vehemently againſt him, and alſo once turning himſelf to his wife, vttered this out of much bitterneſſe of griefe: This child ſeemeth to haue a deſire to make away himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And oftentimes he couered with the ſhee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of his bed, ſome end of a board, or other peece of wood, to the intent that he might giue ſome diſturbance to himſelfe in his ſleepe. But leaſt his body ſhold be free from perpetuall puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, inſteed of a haire cloth which he wanted, he wore (a thing ſtrange &amp; vnheard of) next to his naked body, certaine ſpurs, prepared to ſpur the ſides of horſes, which did ſo faſten in his ſoft fleſh their iron towels, that they vexed him with a cruell torment. By which thing it ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, how wholy he reſigned himſelfe ouer to a more holy courſe of life, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but of the age of thirteene yeares and a halfe, borne in the middeſt of ſo delicate and flouriſhing a fortune, by the inſtruction of no maiſter, handled his body with ſo great auſterity. This holy child acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied theſe forſaid faſts, and other incommodities with which he of his owne accord afflicted his body, with the exerciſe of his mind, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17839:50"/>
with ſo great a cuſtome of prayer, that certaine Officers of his Court, being at theſe publike acts ſolemnly ſworne, denied that they euer came into his cloſet, but they found him buſy at prayer, and oftentymes before he would make an end thereof, they were forced to attend long before the doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</p>
               <p>In the morning, after he was riſen out of his bed, he ſpent a whole houre in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of heauenly things, which he did not meaſure by the running of an houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſle, but by the impulſion of his charity towards God, &amp; the ſenſe of celeſtiall ſwet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Moreouer, he was dayly preſent at Maſſe, and oftentymes aſſiſted the Prieſt; with which office he was wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted. Furthermore, he ſorted himſelfe with the Religious men of the towne, as a ſingular example of edification vnto them, at ſuch time as they offered vp their publike prayers, and prayſes vnto God; the reſt of the day he retyred himſelfe to the reading of holy bookes, or to the conſideration, &amp; deepe diſcuſſion of the hidden myſteries of holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>In the euening, before he tooke himſelfe to reſt, he beſtowed two houres in prayer with ſo much ſenſe of deuotion, that you would thinke it impoſſible for him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue any meane therein. His chamberlaines who waited at the doores, that they might do him ſeruice at his going to bed, were ſo
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17839:51"/>
farre from being wearied with this ſtay, that they profited much by his example, in the way of vertue. Therfore ſometimes they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held through the chinkes of the doore, how he be haued himſelfe in prayer, other ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in imitation of their maiſter, they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues became likewiſe humble ſuppliants to Almighty God. What ſhould I adde any more? He was ſo frequent in his retirement, and cogitation of holy things, that it could not be imputed to vauity, if a man ſhould conſtantly affirme, that he had his mynd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fixed vpon God. Therefore often did the Marques complayne, that he could very hardly draw him out of his chamber, &amp; he did recount to <hi>Fa. Proſperus Malauolta,</hi> that he had often ſeene the place wherein he ſet himſelfe to prayer, moiſtned with his teares.</p>
               <p>Neither truly did he, when the care of any buſineſſe called him out of this priuacy, ſuffer his mind therfore to wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der from that which he had meditated vpon. For whether he had in the morning meditated of Chriſts paſſion, or of any other ſubiect, he did ſo deeply imprint it in his mind, that no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in the day was able to blot it out of his memory. What ſhall I ſay? for that he did not thinke it inough to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to prayer in the day and late in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but for that intent euen in the night, vnknowne to all his ſeruants, his ſtepped out of his bed, and whilſt they were a ſleep,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17839:51"/>
in nothing elſe but his ſhirt, in the darke and ſilent night, in the middeſt of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, allwaies far from any reſting place, he kneeled vpon the bare ground, &amp; in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of celeſtiall matters, ſpent the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the night.</p>
               <p>Neither did he vſe this only in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but alſo in the Winter ſeaſon, which time of the yeare, in <hi>Lombardy</hi> is very ſharp with cold; with which he did ſo tremble all his hody ouer, that he was ſomewhat diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his prefixed meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Which he imputing vnto himſelfe as a fault, did ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g exact of himſelfe with great violence, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come attentiue in his mind towards God, til at laſt, being as it were abſtracted from his ſenſes, he was neuer more vexed with the torment of any cold. But neuertheleſſe his body in the meane while, its vitall heat ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing forſaken all the members, would grow ſo ſtiffe and ſtarke, that being no more able to kneele vpon his knees, and hauing an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion both from ſitting &amp; lying, he would euen ſinke groueling, vpon the bare and cold ground, and lying in that manner, he proſecuted the meditation which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. Wherfore it ſeemed vnto me a ſtrange thing, how he was preſerued from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome grieuous diſeaſe, or from ſtaruing or periſhing with the violence of the cold. Verily he himſelfe when he was now conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to religion did confeſſe to certaine of his familiar friendes, vnto whome he did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

relate theſe vnaduiſed, (for ſo he called them) &amp; ouer-feruorous deeds of his, that whilſt he lay ſo prone vpon the ground, he was ſometimes ſo vtterly deſtitute of ſtrength, that being not able to ſpit from him with his mouth, he was compelled to ſwallow it.</p>

               <p>BY this endeauour of B. <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> to haue all the partes of his mind recollected in his praier, came that paine of his head, which did veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly vexe him all his life after. But he out of a deſire to ſuffer annoyances, and eſpecially ſuch a like paine, as Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his crowne of thornes, was ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeking any remedy for the allaying of it, that he rather tooke diuers courſes to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh &amp; increaſe it: &amp; ſuppoſing it to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to him, ſeing that it did in a manner nothing hinder him from the mannaging of his affaires, it brought into his memory the torments of Chriſt, &amp; gaue him occaſion of meriting ſome reward in Heauen. On a time it happened, that being more ſharply hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that torment then ordinary, he went ſooner to his bed then he was wont. But afterward, as ſoone as it came into his mind, that he had not as yet that day accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17839:52"/>
to his cuſtome, recited the ſeauen peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> he forthwith determined neuer to cloſe his eyes to ſleepe til he had performed that taske. Therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the boy that wayted on him in his chamber, to leaue the candle by his bed ſide, and ſo to go away. Hauing ended thoſe ſeauen <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> being oppreſſed both with ſleepe, and the head-ach, he forgot to put out the candle. The which being wholy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, the fire, when it had taken one ſide of the bed without any flame, crept &amp; ſpred it ſelfe ſo far, til it had ſet on fire all the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes which couered the bed, &amp; one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe ſtuffed with ſtraw, &amp; three with wool. Whilſt the fire had much waſted theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> being awaked, ſo ſoone as he felt ſo great a heat, and moreouer was very much afflicted with the paine of his head, did at the firſt ſuppoſe that he had bene ſick of a feuer: but when he found that all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges elſe were no leſſe hoate to his touch, he could not imagine from whence the violence of that vnuſuall heat ſhould proceed: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he aſſaies againe to ſleepe, but all in vaine. Wherfore when he was almoſt ſuffocated with the increaſing of the heat &amp; ſmoke, he leaps out of his bed, and opening the doore calleth vpon the boy. He had ſcarcely ſet his foot in the entry, when the flame breaking forth conſumed the other part of the bed. Which leaſt the whole houſe ſhould take fire fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame, the ſouldiers,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17839:53"/>
who watched in garriſon about the Caſtle, being raiſed, did caſt downe out of the window into the ditches which were vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Neither is it to be doubted, but that if he had neuer ſo litle deferred the going out of his bed, being eſpecially in a litle cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as I my ſelfe ſaw afterward &amp; that ſhut, he might either haue bene conſumed by the fire, or elſe haue periſhed by being choked with the ſmoke. But queſtionleſſe God, by an eſpeciall prouidence of his, did deliuer from all hurt, him, whome he had now deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned for Religion, being not ignorant for whoſe ſake he was in this danger. Therfore all with one vniforme conſent aſcribed his preſeruation to God, and report alſo was brought to the Dukes themſelues at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> that there had happened a certaine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous thing to the elder ſonne of the Marques: and I know not how long after, <hi>Leonora</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> herſelfe, did in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence deſire to be informed of the whole matter by himſelfe. He ſo ſoone as he knew the matter to be diuulged, (perhaps euen leaſt it ſhould be know ne that his candle ſhould be ſuffered to burne ſo neere him) would very much be abaſhed at that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t afterward, as one that had now well experienced, in diuers chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the watch, and care which the eternall Prouidence had ouer his life, to préfer his prayers before all other counſels, &amp; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to the powerfull diſpoſall of

Almighty God in all Fortunes, and in all both his owne, and his Fathers affaires: hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeeching, that he would only fauour (for in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner in thoſe very wordes was he wont to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend his buſineſſe to God) that which was beſt to be put in execution. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did this hope, &amp; confidence of the loue of God towards him euer deceaue him. For he himſelfe did once not feare to profeſſe, (which ſurely ſeemeth very ſtrange) that he neuer petitioned God at any time in vaine, were his petition great or ſmall: neither that he euer committed to his Prouidence any buſineſſe, how intricate ſoeuer it were, and deſperately loſt in other mens opinions, which did not ſucceed according to his own harts deſire. So open was alwayes the Diuine bounty to his prayers.</p>
               <p>Out of this ſame daily conuerſation with God, ſeemeth that his excellency and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind proceeded, deſpiſing &amp; eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as nothing, whatſoeuer the world poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; then which endowment, he ſaid none was of more valew.

Wherfore he did often in the diſcours which he had with his mother,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17839:54"/>
moſt confidently affirme, that be could not ſufficiently wonder, nor coniecture, what cauſe mortall men could alledg, that they ſhould not all become Religious: For it is more cleare then the ſunne at noone-tide, ſaid he, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities are more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, which Religion bringeth, not only to that future, but euen to this mortall life, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the fiuitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe which are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med principall in this life, is but ſhort, &amp; the thirſters after them are puniſhed with euills both liuing and dying. His mother when ſhe heard him diſcours in this manner, although ſhe eaſily perceaued, what intentions he had in his mind, yet for ſome reſpect ſhe did not at that time, ſo much as reply one word vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17839:55"/>
                  <hi>and to other places ſeated in the dominion of his family. For very willingly his mother endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he should both confer with others, and eſpecially with me. Verily I departed from him astonished, and not without a certaine pleaſant guſt of mind, more inflamed in the loue of vertue, in reſpect of the ſingular example of ſanctity, which shined in his manners, ſententions ſpeach, &amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. All his familiar ſpeach in a manner tended to a certaine exquiſite deſire of humble deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of himſelfe, and to the prayſe of thoſe who ſeparate themſelues from thoſe thinges, which to blind mortall men ſeeme ſo goodly &amp; magnificent. Once alſo he ſaid vnto me; There is no cauſe why we should inſolently boaſt of our anceſtours, ſeing that there is no other difference betweene the ashes of Princes and beggars, but that thoſe of Princes stincke more grieuouſly. In his tender age, he made no shew of childishnes, being of notable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, often with drawing himſelfe from company, and in the meane while remaining ſilent, muſing, graue, and pious. Often he had in his mouth theſe ſpeaches:</hi> O how willingly would I burne with as much loue of God, as might be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſo great a maieſty? my very hart melts with griefe, when I ſee chriſtians ſo vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full towards him.</p>

                  <hi>A token likewiſe of his modeſty, and loue of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, was that his bashfulneſse, ſo full of candour, and ſincerity, that if any one euen in iest, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment had but vttered any one word differing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo little from modeſty, he would with a decent blushing, and with a very modeſt ſigne of griefe,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17839:55"/>
shew a kind of commiſeration of his errour. In the meane while, whilst he heard any one talking of the preceptes of a more perfect life, or relating of any who entred into any Religious Order, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to compoſe his face to greater ſerenity, and to put on another aſpect. Sometime alſo he cried out with a ſigh: Good God, how much pleaſure is there in thoſe ſolid ioyes of Heauen, ſeing that we are ſo much delighted with the ſpeach of them heere vpon earth?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sometimes I went with him into the Church. There he showing the ſignes of a mind moſt humbly and ſubmiſsely worshipping God, did far ſurpaſſe, being but a child, the examples of men of riper yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and of long experience in the profeſsion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Sometimes being as it were in lamentation, other ſometimes his eyes being fixed vpon ſome one of the Saintes pictures, he neither gaue eare to thoſe that called him, nor ſpake to them, neither would he without interpoſing ſome delay, yield the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any anſwere; whereby it manifeſtly appeared his mind was alienated from his ſenſes. He did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten affirme vnto me, that he bare a ſingular deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Bleſsed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin Mary, &amp; that with the only hearing of her name, his hart abounded with incredible ioy.

               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt Reuerend Father, I will reſolue you in briefe that which you requeſt of me. I haue alwaies found in</hi> Aloyſius <hi>our brother, whome from his very childhood I was acquainted within</hi> Spaine, <hi>ſo ſingular a candour and innocency of ſoule, that during all that time, which was for the ſpace of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17839:58"/>
ſome yeares, I was ſo far from finding him guilty of any mortall ſinne (the which he did abhorre as much as any man, neither did he euer commit any in all his life time, but euen very often not ſo much as touched with the leaſt veniall ſinne which might ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in need of abſolution; neither can theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be attributed to any ſlownes of nature, or dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of wit, or vnderſtanding) as who euen at that age, was far liker an old man, then a youth both in grauity of manners, and sharpeneſſe of wit and prudence. He was a great enemy to ſloath and id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneſse. Therfore he was alwaies buſied in honeſt exerciſes, but for the moſt part in reading the holy Bible, in which his mind receaued great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In like manner I noted ſo great modeſty in his ſpeaches, that he neuer gaue offence to any one ſo much as in the least word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe wordes of this Father who had heard his confeſſions, and other which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I purpoſe to ſet downe, it may very clearly appeare, that he in the very middeſt of Court-imployments, liued after a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall and Angelicall manner. For it ought to be accounted a certaine ſingular commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, when one conuerſing in the court, is declared not to be guilty ſo much as of thoſe ſinnes, the which although they are veniall, yet haue need of abſolution.</p>
               <p>In publike he was ſo compoſed, and ſo modeſt, that he neuer ſo much as lifted vp his eyes from the ground. Therfore vpon occaſion of ſuch like ſpeach, he declared when he was now a Religious man, that he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17839:58"/>
was not able to find the way without a guid, neither at <hi>Madrid</hi> where he liued certaine yeares, nor at <hi>Castilion</hi> where he was borne &amp; brought vp: which guide he was wont al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to make vſe of, both leaſt there might any occaſion be giuen of diſtracting the thoughts of his mind, and alſo (as he ſaid) that he might be attentiue to his medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Concerning this modeſty and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his eyes, I do purpoſe truly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a thing very new and vnheard of, which vpon the teſtimony of the Prouinciall of <hi>Naples</hi> of the Society of Ieſus, whom he vſed as his familiar friend, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike monumentes. Thus the matter paſſed. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> as it is ſaid before, tooke his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Spayne</hi> in the company of the Empreſſe, afterward whilſt he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Court, he went almoſt euery day with <hi>Iames</hi> the Prince, to ſalute the ſame Empreſſe, and to conclude, was put vpon a thouſand oportunities to ſee and behould her exactly: Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſo ſingular was his modeſty, that he confeſſed to that Father which I ſpake of, that he had not ſo much as once ſeene her face or viewed her perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And who is ignorant, with how great a deſire all men are poſſeſſed, for the moſt part, of ſeing and curious peruſing, as often as occaſion is offered, all ſuch kind of perſonages placed in dignity, &amp; what great concourſe of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is made to behould them, in thoſe places where they are to paſſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:17839:59"/>
He began euen then, to haue in great eſteeme, ouerworne and old cloathes, and ſtockins with patches vpon the knees, of which the meaneſt men are wont to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Queſtionles, he hauing this corrupt world in contempt, made but little eſteeme what acceptance his deeds had with them who were ſlauiſhly ſubiect therunto. For in like manner he would defer as long as he could the putting on of thoſe new cloathes which were made by his Fathers command, and when he had once or twice gone appare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with them, he did moſt gladly returne to his old ragges againe. Goulden chaines &amp; other ornaments, which the cuſtome of that Court doth applaud, he auoided, ſaying that this was the furniture of them, who propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto themſelues, not the ſeruice of God (as he had reſolued) but the delights of the body, &amp; of Fortune. For this reſpect he had great conflicts with his ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed Father, who interpreted the modeſty of his Sonne, to be the diſgrace of him, and his Family. At the laſt he yielded to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy of his ſonne; and that which for ſome reſpectes before he could not approue, he then began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire. Notwithſtanding although <hi>Aloyſius</hi> did himſelfe make ſo deare account of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, he did neuertheleſſe eaſily ſuffer, that his ſeruants and attendants, ſhold euery one be ſet forth in apparrell according to their office and dignity. His conuerſation with the Nobility of the Court, was ſo full of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17839:59"/>
grauity &amp; Religion, that if they did but ſee him comming, or behould him euen a far of, they brake of their licencious &amp; merry diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and compoſed themſelues to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. And for ſo much as it did manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that he did punctually obſerue, in all his wordes, and actions, all the exact rules of honeſty, and that he could not endure to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vnto his eares any vndecent word, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were in ieſt or in earneſt, it was grown a common prouerbe amongſt the prime men of the Court: <hi>Marchtonem Caſtilionenſem mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norem, non videri carne conſtare,</hi> that, the yong Marques of <hi>Castilion</hi> did not ſeeme to conſiſt of fleſh.

But to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he might

after ſerious deliberation reſolue, what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, amongſt all others was beſt to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, he applied himſelfe with greatet earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then euer before to beſeech Almighty God, that with his celeſtiall light he would vouchſafe to thew, what was ſit to be done in a buſines of ſo great moment. Many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at that time did he reuolue in his mind, of which ſome I haue vnderſtood from his mother, vnto whome he imparted them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome he himſelfe declared vnto vs after he had now entred into religion. But in all thinges he aymed at nothing elſe, but the greater glory of God.</p>
               <p>At the firſt therfore, as he was very much giuen to that ſeuere courſe of life, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his body, he ſeemed in his mind to be inclined, to apply himſelfe to the <hi>Diſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceate</hi> Fathers which is an Order in <hi>Spayne</hi> for ſharpeneſſe of life and auſterity of habit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in name, and authority to that of the <hi>Capuchins</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> And doubtleſſe the lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe of their aſpect, and rigour of their courſe of life, either in reſpect of their retirement to ſolitary places of woods, and groues, of their being adorned in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of great cittyes with excellent examples of holy life, doth not a little as for the moſt part it is wont to do encourage and inuite mindes deſirous to accompliſh that matter well. Put he departed afterward from this his ſuit determination, either for that ſeeing himſelfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17839:61"/>
of puniſhmentes of his owne accord infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vpon himſelfe, broken in his health, he might feare, leaſt if he ſhewed himſelfe leſſe able to comport with it, occaſion might be miniſtred to his friendes to take him againe out of the company of the Religious: or for that he thought it an eaſy matter for him, being accuſtomed to faſting, diſciplining, &amp; other corporall afflictions eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the courts themſelues, to inſiſt vpon theſe without any impeachment, or euen to add new ones vnto them, in whatſoeuer other pious family he ſhould chooſe to liue. Eſpecially, ſeing that his mother (whome he conſulted withall in this matter) was of an opinion, that it was impoſſible in reſpect of his infirme health, for him to liue euen in the world, with ſuch bitter puniſhmentes wherewith hitherto he had weakened himſelfe, much leſſe, long to maintaine his life in any more ſtrict courſe of Religion. And afterward he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with himſelfe, whether it might be an enterpriſe worth his labour, for him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into ſome family, where the ancient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline had bene diſcontinued, and that he might reſtore it againe, firſt to that Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery into which he was receaued, and after by degrees to the whole Order. This truly ſeemed very much to concerne the generall good of the Church. But he contrariwiſe being not ſo bold as to confide in his owne vertue ſo much, began to feare, leaſt if this his proiect ſhould not take good ſucceſſe, he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17839:62"/>
might deceaue himſelfe, and whilſt he goeth about to aid others, depriue himſelfe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary helpes. It ſeemed therefore better vnto him to chooſe ſome Religious Order, which was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now ſtanding in a flouriſhing ſtate, relying vpon its ancient inſtitutions &amp; diſcipline. Wheras there are many of this ſort ſhining in Gods Church, he made little account of thoſe, which without any ſtudy of contemplation, ſet themſelues wholy v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon action, &amp; accommodate themſelues on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do good to the bodies of others, which he ſaid he did not ſo well reliſh. Next vnto theſe there came vnto his mind, thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which being wholy ſeparated from the ſociety of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in woods or townes, only ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues (of which ſort are moſt of the companies of the Monkes) quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to get the perfect loue of God, by ſinging vnto him ſacred hymnes, and by the reading or contemplating of celeſtiall thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And from the life of theſe, he was ſo far from being auerſed, that he did ſeeme euen with ſome willing inclination to be diſpoſed theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to. For what? he that in Princes courts and in the middeſt of thoſe trobleſome noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of men, was able to recall his mind from them, and place it in quiet; ſhould he not more eaſily find the ſame, in the houſes of Religious men, being ſequeſtred far from the world, and commerce of men? But he who did not only reſpect that which might make for the quiet of his mind, &amp; the glory
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17839:62"/>
of God, but went in continuall queſt after whatſoeuer might be auailable for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory of God, thought that any talent which was le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto him by Almighty God, and that he might lay out for the ſaluation of ſoules, ſhould by him as it were be buried in ſolitude, and made of noyſe. Moreouer as ſome affirme, and we hereafter will declare, he had read in that booke of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> the Angelicall Doctour, intituled <hi>the Summe of Diuinity,</hi> that thoſe Religious orders are in the principall degree of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who beſtow their labours &amp; endeauours in teaching, preaching, &amp; prouiding for the ſaluation of ſoules. For ſo much as they not content with the contemplation of holſome thinges, do communicate vnto others that which they haue ſifted out by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Likewiſe that they come very neere to the ſimilitude of that life, which the Sonne of God, the ſquare &amp; rule of all perfect ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, lead here vpon earth. For neither was he alwayes retired into deſert places, in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of his Father, and contemplation, neyther did he alwayes inſtruct his diſciples, or preach to the people, but intercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geably; ſometimes he aſcended vp to the mountains and ſolitary places, to offer vp his prayers to God, other ſometimes he deſcending from thence into the company of men, inſtructed the ignorant with excellent precepts for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Wherfore <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> of his owne accord,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17839:63"/>
waining himſelfe as it were from the milke of eaſe and celeſtiall delicacies, which he might haue enioyed in that ſilence, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a Monaſticall life, determined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelfe to ſome Sodality, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying it ſelfe in office, mixt &amp; tempered betweene action and contemplation, might both apply the ſtudy of learning, &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the labour of bringing other men to ſaluation and perfect vertue, with the care of himſelfe. But for ſo much as there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies in Gods Church aſſembled for this end, who euery one after their proper manner &amp; inſtitution liue holily therin; he began to compare, amongſt themſelues, all their ſeuerall meanes, helpes, &amp; exerciſes, by the which they endeauour to obtaine that end which they propound vnto themſelues. After therfore he had long, &amp; much delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated vpon the whole matter, and had often made his prayers vnto Almighty God, it pleaſed him in concluſion to make choyce of this, the loweſt &amp; lateſt begun Society of all others, the which he thought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed for him by God, and moſt oportunely ſorting to his ends.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. For foure cauſes he made choyce of the Society of Ieſus.</head>
               <p>BVT he alledged foure cauſes which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him, to prefer this Society be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other families, and he ſaid, that they gaue him great contentment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:17839:63"/>
The firſt was, for ſo much as the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therof, being as it were in the perfect vigour of a confirmed age, do hitherto flouriſh entire, and vnblemiſhed, and neuer declined into any worſe eſtate, by innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Another was, for that therin a ſpeciall vow is taken, wherby all power of ſeeking after Eccleſiaſticall dignities, or of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them being offered (vnleſſe the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Pope himſelfe be interpoſed) is taken away. For truly he feared, leaſt if he ſhould adioyne himſelfe to any Religious order which would not refuſe them, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometime drawne from thence by the will of his friends, he might be preferred <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> to ſome degree of dignity in the Church; which ſo long as he continued in the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he vnderſtood would not in like ſort be in their power.</p>
               <p>The third was, for that he ſaw in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, many wayes, and courſes to inſtruct youth in the feare of God, &amp; the precepts of chaſtity, both by open ſchooles of good literature, and alſo by the conſtituting of pious Sodalities. For whoſoeuer doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in cultiuating thoſe tender plantes, &amp; in defending them by the preſeruatiues of pious exhortations, and the vſe of holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, both from the froſt-biting of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; the luſtfull heat of all exorbitant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, him he thought both to merit much at the hands of the Diuine maieſty, and to do
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17839:64"/>
vnto him a thing infinitely gratefull &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>The fourth was, for ſo much as the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with a peculiar endeauour negotiateth the reducing of Heretikes to the lap of the holy Catholike Church, and the conuerſion of <hi>Gentiles, Indians, Iaponians,</hi> and <hi>Americans</hi> vnto Chriſt: Wherfore he was lead with a hope, that one day that fortune likewiſe might betide him, to be ſent for the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men into thoſe coaſtes.</p>
               <p>Hauing made this abſolute Election, the bleſſed young man did his endeauour to be made as certaine as poſſibly he might be, of the wall of God. He determined therfore for this purpoſe, to receaue the Bleſſed Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, vpon ſome feſtiuall day of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lady, that by her meanes commending it to God, he might be inſtructed what his diuine will was therin. A conuenient day approached, a feaſt of the memory of her Aſſumption into Heauen, the yeare 1583. and of his age the 15. and a halfe. When that day came, early in the morning, hauing before prayed very longe, and prepared himſelfe with extraordinary diligence, he was refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with that celeſtiall meat. After this whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he inſiſted very much vpon rendring than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to Almighty God, and beſeeching him by the merits of his Virgin Mother, that he would pleaſe to inſtruct him in that which might be moſt acceptable to his Diuine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, behold a cleare, and manifeſt voyce is

vttered, which commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him to become a Religious man in the Society of Iesvs, &amp; (as he afterward declared to his mother, and others after his entrance into Religion) that he ſhould impart it preſently to his Ghoſtly Father.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX. He diſcloſeth his vocation vnto his Confeſsarius, and after to his Mother, and his Father.</head>

The Father, when he had diligently diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both the beginning &amp; progreſſe of this his intention, at laſt gaue this anſwere: that ſurely this aduiſe ſeemed to be very ſenerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne, and giuen from God himſelfe, but that it could neuer be effected, vnleſſe the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques his Father conſented therunto, for if he ſhould proue repugnant, the Fathers of the Society would neuer admit his Sonne.

               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:17839:65"/>
But he, wheras his burning zeale of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating himſelfe to God brake through all delayes, that very day opened the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his mother. She tooke to great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in this reſolution of her ſonnes, that ſhe did exhibite humble thankes vnto Almighty God for the ſame, &amp; very cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully after the example of <hi>Anna,</hi> did preſent &amp; dedicare him to his Diuine Maieſty. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer ſhe did firſt certify the Marques of this matter, and wheras he was very much incenſed at the heating of this vnexpected meſſage, ſhe did ſomewhat mitigate his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Neither did ſhe euer after omit to fauour &amp; aſſiſt him in this buſines. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Marques, not knowing with how ſerue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a deſire his wife wiſſhed to haue ſcare one of her ſonnes to become the ſeruant of God in ſome Religious courſe, began to ſuſpect, that ſhe was partially carried with ſome priuate affection towards <hi>Roauiph,</hi> and to the intent that he might ſet foot into the inheritance of his Fathers Principality, ſhe would willingly haue the other tied in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>And not much after, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> himſelfe with great ſubmiſſion and reuerence went to his Father, and with a bold courage, and moſt apt ſpeach denounced vnto him, that he was reſolued to ſpend the reſidue of his life in Religion. Vpon this the Marques be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inflamed with anger, rebuking him with many hard and ſharpe ſpeaches, bids him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17839:65"/>
out of his preſence; moreouer threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him that he would cauſe him to be whipped naked. Vnto which <hi>Aloyſius</hi> mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly replied: <hi>Vtinam eo me Deus beneficio digne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, vt istuc eius amore perferam:</hi> O that it would pleaſe Almighty God to vouchſafe me that fauour, that I might ſuffer it for the loue of him. Hauing ſaid this, he departed. The Marques being deeply wounded with griefe, conuerting his furious anger againſt his ſonnes Ghoſtly Father though then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, did, and ſaid theſe thinges which a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed mind, &amp; headlong paſſion dictated vnto him; neither for certaine dayes afer, tooke he any reſt at all. So great a ſtroke did he thinke to be giuen to his affaires, and to receaue ſo much detriment by this his ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes purpoſe. Some few dayes after, ſending for the Father whom his Sonne vſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer himſelfe to in confeſsion, he did vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently expoſtulate with him, and complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he had poſſeſſed with this mind, the eldeſt ſonne of his Houſe, vpon whome repoſed the whole hope therof. The Father anſwered, that ſome few dayes before that time, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> had imparted vnto him this reſolution, and that he himſelfe was able to teſtify as much: But yet he did eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture by the courſe which he held in his life, that at laſt he wold intertaine the ſame. Then the Marques being ſomewhat milder turning himſelfe to <hi>Aloyſius</hi> who ſtood by, ſaid, that he ſhould leſſe haue erred if he had
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17839:66"/>
choſen any other order. Vnto whome <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> gaue ſo wiſe an anſwere, that it tooke from the Marques all power of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. That may be vnderſtood by the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle which before I commended of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Conſeſsarius;</hi> in which he ſpeaketh thus of <hi>Aloyſius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the admonishment giuen vnto him from Almighty God for the entring into Religion, two things very well worthy of conſideration fell out. Priety I neuer made mention therof vnto him, not withstanding I did euer preſage in my mind, by the carriage of himſelfe, that which ſucceeded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. But afterward vpon the day of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Bleſſed Mother of God into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, when he applied himſelfe (as often he was wont to do) to the Sacraments of pennance &amp; the Euchariſt, about noone he came to diſcloſe vnto me, that when he, in the middeſt of thoſe Diuine bankets be ſought Almighty God by the mediation of the Bleſſed Virgin, that he would vouchſafe to shew what courſe of life it was his pleaſure he should ſet downe vnto himſelfe, that he heard a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>re and manifest voyce, which commaunded him to imbrace a Religious inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Ieſus. Afterward the Marques his Father, wheras he was vehemently vexed with this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſonne, and notwithſtanding perceaued him ſo conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therin, ſpake vnto him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whriſt I was preſent:</hi> Truly my Sonne, I would thou hadſt rather choſen any other order then this, for then thou mightſt haue bene capable of ſome dignity, which might
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17839:66"/>
haue added to the ſplendour of our family; of which thou muſt alwayes reſt deſtitute in the Society, that abandoneth all Honours. <hi>Surely, anſwered the young man, one of the cauſes for which I preferred the Society before other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious courſes, was euen this, for ſo much as I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to intercept all paſſages to ambition. For if I were delighted with any dignity, certainly I would enioy the title of Marques, which Almighty God hath conferred vpon me as my birth-right, neither would I change a certainty, for an vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Theſe are the wordes of the Epiſtle it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>His ghoſtly Father being departed, the Marques muſing dayly vpon this his ſonnes proiect, it came into his mind to ſuſpect, that <hi>Aloyſius</hi> vpon ſet purpoſe had inuented this meanes, to reclay me him from gaming, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he was incredibly addicted; for not many daies before that, he had loſt ſome thouſands of crownes. And that very eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wherein <hi>Aloyſius</hi> had thus opened his mynd vnto him, he had plaid away other 600. crownes. Which humour truly of play was ſo diſtaſtfull to <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> that oftentimes his Father being very much engaged in play, he wold retire himſelfe into his chamber to deplore him. He ſaid in like manner to thoſe of his chamber, that he did not ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate his Fathers loſſe, as the iniury which was offered towards Almighty God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this his Fathers ſuſpition did not ſeeme to be without a cauſe. Neither was this the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17839:67"/>
opinion only of the Marques, but of all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſed in the Court, who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the paſſages that were betweene the Marques and his ſonne, infinitely extolled the prudence of <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> who out of feare of further loſſes, attempted to withdraw his Father from play. But when as he being of a conſtant mind, and firme in his purpoſe, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured to obtaine leaue, to performe that which he was commaunded by inſtinct from God, and made profeſſion that he only aymed at the ſeruice of Almighty God; the Marques, eſpecially when he reflected vpon his life, which from his very childhood, he had after an Angelicall manner ſpent in the meditation of matters of piety, was at laſt perſuaded, that his ſonne ſpake ſeriouſly, &amp; that this intention was put into him by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inſpiration. A greater proofe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hereunto by the authority of the moſt Reuerend Father, <hi>Mr. Francis Gonzaga</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter-Generall of the Fathers Obſeruant of the Order of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> who was very neere allied to the Marques in kindred and conſanguinity, who when at that time he was imployed in viſiting the Prouinces of his order in <hi>Spayne,</hi> and at the requeſt of the Marques had for the ſpace of two houres, curiouſly ſearched into <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> was ſo far forth ſatisfyed with his anſweres, that he aſſured his Father, it was not lawfull to doubt, but that this mind was giuen to him by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:17839:67"/>
And although the Marques did plainely vnderſtand, what the vocation of God was towards his ſonne, notwithſtanding he could not perſwade his mind to reſigne him ouerto him, but as long as he could he detained him with faire allurements. This <hi>Aloyſius</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as one impatient of delaies, after the death of <hi>Iames</hi> the Prince, who was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a feuer (whoſe funerall rites toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the whole traine of the Court, he performed in the Eſcuriall) being freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the neceſſity of ſeruing the Court, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a certaine politike meanes to try whether he might proceed with his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or no. Therfore, when vpon a certaine time, he came to the Fathers of the Society of IESVS, he willeth his yonger brother <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulfus,</hi> and other his familiar friendes who were preſent with him, to returne home, for he did firmely reſolue to remaine there, without euer going backe to his home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. They, when they perceaued this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his to be ſincere and not faigned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted homeward, and gaue account to the Marques (then ſicke of the gout) of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the whole matter. He ſendeth vnto him Doctor <hi>Saluſtius Petrocenus</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Caſtilion,</hi> his Auditour, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him to returne home with him. <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> giueth anſwere, that, what muſt be done to morrow, may be done to day. That it was a great contentment for him to remaine in that place; that he did humbly beſeech his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17839:68"/>
Father, that he wold vouchſafe him that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. The Marques hauing receaued this anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, thought it an indignity to paſſe the matter ouer ſo, and ſhould otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an obloquy to the Kings whole court. Therfore ſending the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune his returne, he ſheweth himſelfe obedient, and returneth.</p>
               <p>Another time, vpon occaſion of ſpeach with Father Generall <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> whome I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before, the Marques beſought him, by that their kindred, and common friendſhip, that for ſo much as he did ſufficiently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how much the loſſe of ſuch a ſonne, who was able ſo wiſely &amp; religiouſly to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne his people, would be againſt the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his dominion, he would be pleaſed to dehort, &amp; diſſuade him from this his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of becomming religious; moreouer that in the world inſiſting in his degree, he might do that ſeruice, which might be much for the honour of God. Whome the Generall anſwered in this manner, that he wold pleaſe to pardon him, if he were not anſwerable to this his requeſt, for ſo much as it was not correſpondent to the Inſtitutions of that courſe of life which he profeſſed, nor euen to the duty of a chriſtian man. The Marques vrgeth that at the leaſt he would deale with him, not to enter into Religion in <hi>Spayne,</hi> but that he would take his iourny backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with him into <hi>Italy.</hi> And that there he promiſed him to make him partaker of his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17839:68"/>
vow. The Father Generall who well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that he himſelfe, when in the Court of the ſame Catholike King he firſt applied his mind to be of the Order of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> after that his parents had ſpent many diſſuaſiue wordes in vaine, and that they had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with that traine of pollicy to bring him backe into <hi>Italy,</hi> to the intent that they might more oportunely, with all cunning meanes ſupplant his purpoſe, that he at laſt refuſed to condeſcend vnto them, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his habit in <hi>Spayne,</hi> ſaid vnto the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques that euen this office could not be done with a ſafe conſcience, and that he himſelfe did make a ſcruple therof. Neuertheleſſe he denied not to do it. After this, he declared vnto <hi>Aloyſius</hi> both the Marques his requeſt and withall his anſwere, &amp; added moreouer that he was ſomewhat ſcrupulous to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer theſe his Fathers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundes vnto him, although he promiſed to giue him full power to diſpoſe of himſelfe in <hi>Italy.</hi> The young man with his accuſtomed facility made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the Generall, that he truly would moſt willingly in this matter giue content to his Father, neither was it any thing at all troubleſome vnto him, as who foreſaw all things that might fall out, and ſeemed ſo conſtant &amp; ſtable, in that which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in his mind, that being aſſiſted by God, no human force was able to wreſt him from it. That therfore he had no cauſe to feare any thing, that might happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17839:69"/>
The Father-Generall informed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of all thinges, and to conclude all was ſo accompliſhed, that both their wils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in one.</p>

               <p>IN the yeare 1584. when <hi>Iohn Andreas Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> being of late by the Catholike King made Admirall, with great power by ſea bent his courſe with Gallies for <hi>Italy;</hi> it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med good to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Marques, to tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelfe, his wife, and his children thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſame veſſels. When he was there ready to take ſhip, Father Generall <hi>Gonzaga</hi> hauing now acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed his buſineſſe, both of viſiting his order, and likewiſe other that he had in <hi>Spayne,</hi> yielded himſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion vnto them in this voyage. I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſe in wordes, how ioyfull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious a fortune <hi>Aloyſius</hi> did repute it to himſelfe, that he might enioy the ſociety of ſo Reuerend a Father, vpon whome ſo often as he caſt his eyes, he might ſeeme to behold an excellent mirrour of religious life, &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere diſcipline. And he afterward recounted vnto me, that he to the intent that he might reape profit by his example, did very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerue all his manners and actions, and that he found him ſuch a man, as might excellently well maintaine the name of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ouer the Friars Obſeruant, and that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17839:69"/>
Office likewiſe, with great accompliſhment of vertue, and with ſingular documents of exemplar life. Furthermore, how true an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, &amp; that grounded vpon ſolid reaſons <hi>Aloyſius</hi> in that iourny entertained of this man, did euen more clearly diſconer it ſelfe, after that he was firſt made Biſhop of <hi>Cefatu</hi> in <hi>Sicily;</hi> and after of <hi>Mantua.</hi> For ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and holy was his conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alwayes in that degree of dignity, that it is now a thing euident, to all that either knew him, or at any time had conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him, that he inſiſted in the footſteps of thoſe ancient Biſhops, which were moſt remarkable for the glory of ſanctity, &amp; that he might very worthily be propoſed for a maiſter-peece to all, who out of Religious Families are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to the gouernement of the Church. Wherin I would more in large my ſelfe, were it not, that I might feare to offend the moſt modeſt and humble mind of ſo great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, who is euen now liuing whilſt I write theſe thinges.</p>
               <p>The conuerſation of this man abounding ſo with honeſty &amp; innocency, made that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation both very pleaſant, &amp; ſhort to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius,</hi> whilſt they diſcourſed between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues either of the various places of diuine bookes, or of the rules of a pure lyfe, he aduiſing with this good Father of thoſe thinges which ſeemed difficult in that kind. They arriued in <hi>Italy</hi> in the moneth of <hi>Iuly</hi> in that ſame yeare, when <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17839:70"/>
age of ſixteene yeares &amp; foure moneths. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius</hi> was hopefull to obtaine his purpoſe very ſpeedily by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the Marques his Father, and therfore omitted not to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite it. But the Marques denied to condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend thereunto, till that he had, togeather with his brother <hi>Rodulph</hi> ſaluted in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe all the Princes &amp; Dukes of <hi>Italy.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he was to betake himſelfe to this iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He did that with this pollicy, for ſo much as he hoped it might by litle &amp; little rebate that his zeale of entring into Religion.</p>
               <p>Therfore <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> togeather with his brother and a great retinue, puts himſelfe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his way, and very officiouſly he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with all the Great-ones of <hi>Italy</hi> one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another. <hi>Rodulphus</hi> (who had not yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together exceeded his childhood) went ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled gorgiouſly, and accommodated as beſt might beſeeme his dignity: but <hi>Aloyſius</hi> ſutable to his modeſty, wore a plaine ſuite of blacke ſtuff, which they commonly call <hi>Flanders-Serge,</hi> being ſtill an enemy to all vaine brauery. For wheras the Marques had ordained to be made for him, certaine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered garments, ſet forth in ſo coſtly a manner, that they ſeemed all couered ouer with gould, with which being apparelled he went to preſent his ſeruice to the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spayne,</hi> wife to the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> he could neuer after, ſo ſoone as he had once ſet foot in <hi>Italy,</hi> be perſuaded ſo much as once to put them on. Sometimes alſo it happened at
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17839:70"/>
                  <hi>Castilio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that he wore his breeches very much torne, which leaſt they ſhould be perceaued, and changed for better, he couered them with his cloake; but there was a time, when going vp a paire of ſtaires, while he ſtoupeth to toke vp his beads that were fallen downe, he was noted by his Gouernor to be clothed with ſuch old breeches, that in ſome places they ſhewed euen his naked skin. Then ſaid he: <hi>Domine Aloyſi, quid tandem agis? tibi tuo<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neri probro non eſſe ſentis?</hi> My Lord <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> what do you meane I pray you? are you not ſenſible of the diſgrace that you do to your ſelfe and your family? and without delay ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away thoſe, he commaundeth him to put on others. He fearing I imagine, leaſt the matter ſhould come to Marques his eare, durſt not vſe any contradiction.</p>
               <p>Being vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his iourny, he buſied his mind, either in reciting his prayers to Almighty God, or in meditating daily ſome things of that nature; neither did he euer omit either his accuſtomed faſts, or his euening prayers. As ſoone as he came to his lodging, he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe into ſome priuate cloſet, and ſought for ſome picture of a Crucifixe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which he might pray; if he could find none, he either with a cole, or inck drew a croſſe for his deuotion vpon a paper, &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe before it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his knees, he ſpent one, or more houres in praying, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining himſelfe with piety toward God. So ſoone as he came vnto any towne, in which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17839:71"/>
there was any houſe, or Colledge of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, hauing performed the ſalutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Princes, he forthwith went to ſee the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; hauing entred the Colledge, he firſt of all went ſtraight to the Church, humbly to ſalute the Bleſſed Sacrament, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo long as his leaſure might ſerue him, he enioyed the familiar diſcourſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he went to tender his ſeruice to the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> two thinges happened very well worth the memory. The one was when he lodged at <hi>Auguſta</hi> amongſt thoſe of <hi>Turino,</hi> in the houſe of the moſt illuſtrious man <hi>Hierome Roboreus</hi> his neere Kinſman, who afterward was choſen into the colledge of <hi>Cardinals;</hi> and being there in a certayne parlour in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of many noble young gentlemen, an old man of ſeauenty yeares of age, who was by chance preſent began to caſt forth certaine immodeſt ſpeaches. This verily did very much diſguſt <hi>Aloyſius.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with great freedome he conteſteth with the man in this manner: <hi>Syr, ought you not to be ashamed, being a man ſo well borne, and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſo good parts, both of Nature and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to ſpeake of theſe kind of things in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of theſe Noble Gentlemen? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily this is to ſcandalize the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; expoſe them to danger of ſinne, for ſo ſayth S. Paul: Corrumpunt bonos mores col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquia praua: Bad diſcourſes corrupt good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Hauing ſaid this, and taking a little booke of piety into his hand, to the intent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17839:71"/>
that he might ſhew himſelfe to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he departed out of that company, into another with-drawing roome. So that old man being ſtroken with ſhame, example of modeſty was giuen to the reſt. The other was, that when <hi>Hercules Tanus</hi> his vncle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certified of his comming to <hi>Auguſta</hi> of <hi>Turino,</hi> came to ſalute him, and earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him, that to the intent he might vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit his neyghbours, and gratify them all, he would vouchſafe to goe to <hi>Cherio,</hi> togeather with his brother, where he neuer yet had bene, he condeſcending to his inuitement tooke that iourny. But wheras for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace of theſe Princes his nephewes, the ſame <hi>Hercules</hi> had prepared a ſolemne feaſt, at which as the cuſtome is, there was proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for dauncing, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> at the firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured all that he could not to be preſent, afterward being wearied-out with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of many, who alledged that all this magnificence was ordained as a friendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of the ioy that they conceaued for his arriuall, he ſuffered himſelfe to be brought into the Parlour, in which there was aſſembled a great concourſe of noble men and women, hauing firſt before, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely profeſſed, though he were preſent, yet he would neyther daunce, nor do any thing elſe. This being agreed vpon, he had fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely taken his place, but that there ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vp one of thoſe noble <hi>Ladies,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiteth him to daunce. Vpon that occaſion
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17839:72"/>
taking ſome diſpleaſure, vttering not ſo much as one word, as it were compelled by ſome neceſſity, he withdrew himſelfe out of the place, &amp; neuer more returned. Not very long after, <hi>Hercules</hi> hauing gone forth in vaine to ſeeke him, at laſt, when vpon ſome other buſines he paſſed through the Serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts lodgings, he ſeeth <hi>Aloyſius</hi> hidden in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner betweene a bed and the wall, kneeling v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his knees at his prayers. At which thing ſtanding in admiration, not without ſome improuement in vertue, he neuer preſuming to interrupt him, left him to his deuotions.</p>

               <p>HAVING performed theſe officious ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations, remaining confident that the Marques would ſtand to his promiſe, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe him, he returneth to <hi>Castilion.</hi> But ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely this hope did much faile him.

               <p>And firſt of all <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illiam</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who alwayes bare a ſpeciall affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> ſent to him a certaine Biſhop, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very eloquent, to <hi>Castilion</hi> where he dwelt, who ſhould declare vnto him as from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that for ſo much as he ſeemed to ſet naught by the life of a lay man, as tending too much to liberty, and profaneneſſe, that he ſhould at leaſt content himſelfe in their courſe, who not deſpiſing the commodities of Fortune, do likewiſe performe the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church. That there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnto him in this kind of life, more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to performe excellent thinges, both for the glory of God, &amp; profit of men, then in that which Religious men, liue in. That there were not wanting men, neither in the memory of our anceſtors nor ours, that were ſingular in ſanctity (in the number of which he thought <hi>Carolus Borromeus</hi> that moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Cardinall to be one) who, as they did not abſtaine from the wielding of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Church, ſo were they more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailable therunto then many that ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their time in Monaſteries. Laſt of all, he promiſed vnto him all his endeauour &amp; fauour for the obtayning of ſome ſuch kind of Honour. This Biſhop played his part very well, with great force of eloquence, and with very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite reaſons to perſuade him. But <hi>Aloyſius</hi> after that he had prudently made anſwere
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17839:73"/>
to them all, moſt earneſtly beſought him, that he would pleaſe to render great tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes to the Duke, for the loue which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſhewed towards him, by the impulſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof he had ſo much at this tyme enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelfe in his reſpect to him. That he, euen as of his owne freewill he had ſtripped himſelfe of all other Honourable aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which he might haue accepted from his Houſe and Family, ſo that he did moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly remit vnto the Duke, this preferment which he ſo bountifully did offer him. That he, for that reaſon chiefly, was induced to wiſh the entring into the Society, for ſo much as it reiected all kind of honours. For he had fully reſolued whilſt he liued, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count God for his chiefeſt treaſure.</p>
               <p>Another attempt was made vpon <hi>Aloyſius</hi> by <hi>Alfonfus,</hi> his Vncle by the Fathers ſide, vnto whome he was next to ſucceed in the gouernement of <hi>Caſtle-Godfrey,</hi> who when he had propoſed the like argumentes that the Duke had, receaued the like anſwers.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe another man of great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſame Family of the <hi>Gonzaga's,</hi> after many arguments vrged for the infringing of his purpoſe, at laſt inclined to the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of him from the Society, &amp; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him, that ſeeing he determined to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the world, that paſſing ouer the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that liueth in the middeſt therof, he ſhold betake himſelfe to the <hi>Capuchins, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſians,</hi> or ſome other Family, far remote
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17839:73"/>
from theſe imployments. Surely I imagine that this he ſaid with that intention, that if <hi>Aloyſius</hi> had wauered in his mind from a will to follow that which he had made choyſe of, that he wold haue taken occaſion to haue taxed him with inconſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, &amp; ſo to haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted his whole purpoſe. Or truly (which he might more eaſily haue done afterward) to the intent that he might terrify him from other religious orders, as being not able to brooke them in reſpect of the weakenes of his body, and health. Or to conclude, for ſo much as, out of other Orders, he might more eaſily be reduced to ſome degree of dignity in the Church. Vnto theſe propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Aloyſius</hi> anſwered briefly, that he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew not by what other meanes then by entring into the Society, to eſtrange him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe further from the affaires of the world. For if he would ſignify Riches, vnder the name of the world, there did in the Society flouriſh an exact loue of Pouerty, where it was lawfull for no one to haue propriety in any thing. But if vnder the denomination of the world, he did comprehend titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity, that the Society likewiſe had no way open vnto them, as hauing taken a vow, wherby they profeſſe, that they will neither procure, nor ſo much as accept thoſe honours which are offered them (which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes hath bene done by Kings, &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) vnleſſe the Pope according to his power commaund them. So he put that noble man
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17839:74"/>
to ſilence, and gaue a ſufficient teſtimony vnto others, vnto whome the fame of this matter was diuulged, that he was conſtant in that intention which was inſpired vnto him by God.</p>
               <p>The Marques likewiſe vnderhand ſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to ſound his mind, as chiefly <hi>Ioanues Iacobus</hi> the Archprieſt of <hi>Caſtilion</hi> (whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority bare a great ſtroke with <hi>Aloyſius)</hi> who might perſuade him not to renounce the titles of the Marqueſate, and the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of his Country. But <hi>Aloyſius</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged this man with ſo great waight of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that he forſaking the embaſſy of the Father, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to negotiate for the ſonne, and indeauoured to make proofe vnto the Marques, that his mind had a peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from God, to giue ouer the thinges of the world. And he conceaued ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterward of <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> when he made him partaker of his ſecrets, that he neuer after made any end of extolling his ſanctity. But the Marques reſted not yet ſatisfied with all that induſtry, with which he had oppugned his ſonne; and therefore he moſt earneſtly intreated, a certaine Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, a ſpeciall friend of his, (who at that time flouriſhed with the fame of a very eloquent preacher, &amp; afterward being made a prelate ouer a certaine Church, died in that function) that for his fake ſetting vpon his ſonne with all his forces, he would diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him from that his enterpriſe. He not ſo
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17839:74"/>
much of his owne will, as that he durſt not ſhift of the commaund of the Marques, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking that taske, performed it with as much maſtery of eloquence as he could.

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. The Marques ſtrongly oppoſeth the vocation of his ſonne: at last he yieldeth.</head>
               <p>THE Marques finding that the mind of <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was no whit at all moued with ſo many encounters, wheras being ſicke of the goute he kept his bed, to make triall of him, ſending for him, asketh him: what now at laſt his mind was? he truly anſwered reuerently, and yet poſitiuely; that he both is, and alwayes was of a mind, to ſerue God in that courſe of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he had ſpoken of. With this anſwere the Marques being vehemently enraged, with a menacing cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and bitter words, bid him auoyd out of his preſence. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> interpreting this rebuke as a commaund, departed to the Monaſtery of <hi>Saint Mary,</hi> inhabited by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17839:75"/>
the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Brothers, commonly called the <hi>Socculanti,</hi> one mile from <hi>Caſtilion.</hi> This Monaſtery is ſeated by a delicate &amp; pleaſant Lake, that taketh its beginning from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine waters, which ſliding down from thoſe faire hils are reſtrained with artificiall banc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, being built in that place, which in times paſt to haue bene of great eſteeme, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things giue teſtimony, to wit, both certaine vaults adorned with ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t checker-worke, and alſo certaine ſprings of holſome waters, which in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner with old work, running through their channels vnder-ground, and about that houſe (which for the retirement of himſelfe, and his children was built by Marques <hi>Ferdinand)</hi> diſcouer themſelues, &amp; breake forth into a moſt pleaſant well. Into this houſe did <hi>Aloyſius</hi> withdraw himſelfe; whither when he had commaunded his bed, his bookes, &amp; other neceſſaries of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be carried, he ſet down vnto himſelfe a courſe of life far remote from the eyes of men, by often diſciplining himſelfe, and ſpending all his time in prayer, whilſt that in the meane while, no man durſt intimate theſe thinges to the Marques leaſt he ſhould be moued to further anger. Within ſome few dayes after, the Marques, (who yet by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the goute kept his bed) asked what became of <hi>Aloyſius?</hi> So ſoone as he knew that he remained in this Monaſtery, which I ſpake of before, ſtraight way commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him to be recalled, and ſending for him
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17839:75"/>
into his chamber, ſets vpon him with many ſharpe ſpeaches, and reprehendeth him, that without his commaund (to the intent that, as he ſaid, he might prouoke him with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contempt) he was ſo bold, as to go out of his houſe. But <hi>Aloyſius</hi> quietly, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſiuely anſwered, that he verily went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that he thought himſelfe therin, to be obedient to his commaund, wherby he charged him to auoyd out of his preſence. The Marques proceeded in caſting forth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers terrible and threatning words againſt him, and in fine commaunded him to betake himſelfe to his owne lodgings: then ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius, Quia ſic iubes, vado;</hi> Becauſe you ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Entring into his chamber, ſhutting the doores, before a picture of Chriſt crucified, he beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth an humble ſuppliant vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and there whilſt he imploreth of him, a conſtant and couragious mind in ſuch aduerſity, his teares flow plentifully: And with daily whipping of himſelfe he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condeth his teares. In the meane-while the Marques, in whoſe breſt the naturall loue of his ſonne, made warre againſt his conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for ſo much as he both feared to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the will of God, neither yet could he ſo far get the conqueſt ouer himſelfe, as to be depriued of ſo deere and vertuous a ſonne, fearing leaſt he had contriſtated him too much with ſo ſharpe a chiding, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what relenting for that which he had done,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17839:76"/>
ſending for the Lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the towne who then wayted in the outward Hall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him to go ſee what <hi>Aloyſius</hi> doth.</p>
               <p>He in the entry of his chamber, found his Chamberlayne, who could vnto this man, that <hi>Aloyſius</hi> ſhutting the doores, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them to trouble him. But the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, when he ſaid that he had order giuen him from the Marques, that he ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue what he was doing, commeth to the doore, and finding himſelfe shut forth, he boreth the ſame ſomwhat with his poyniard betweene the chinkes. From hence doth he behould <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> with his backe all naked &amp; kneeling with his knees all bare, before a Crucifix, weeping, and rigorouſly ſcourging himſelfe. The Lieutenant being moued with this ſpectacle, and melting with a certaine ſenſe of piety, with his cheekes all bedewed with teares returneth to the Marques, and ſaid, that he would neuer go about to recal <hi>Aloyſius</hi> from Religion, vnto which he was reſolued to dedicate himſelfe, if he did but behould what thing he was in doing. At laſt being asked what it was that he had ſeene, and why he wept ſo? he anſwered, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily he had ſeene thoſe thinges, which no man could behould without weeping: and withall he relateth the whole matter to the Marques being all aſtoniſhed, and ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely giuing credit to that which the man ſpake.</p>
               <p>The day after, at the ſame houre, vpon ſet

purpoſe, being certified what he was doing, he commaundeth himſelfe to be carried in a chaire to his chamber, which was built v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſame floore with his, and through a certaine hole which was already open, he ſaw his ſonne againe weeping and executing voluntary puniſhment vpon himſelfe. The behoulding of this thing did ſo mooue the Marques, that he ſtood there for a certaine time transfixed with aſtoniſhment, and as it were in an extaſy. But afterward ſeeming to take no knowledge of that which had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he cauſeth a noyſe to be made, and the doores to be knocked at. After this, entring in with his wife, he findeth the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinckled with diuers drops of bloud by his whipping, and that place where he had kneeled, all moiſt-ouer with his teares, as if water had bene ſpilt. This ſpectacle, and the dayly prayers wherwith his ſonne importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, at laſt compelled him to put on a mind, to giue him leaue, to put in execution that which he deſired.</p>
               <p>Therfore writing his letters to <hi>Rome,</hi> he intreated <hi>Scipio Gonzaga</hi> a very noble Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leman (who then was <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and after created <hi>Cardinall)</hi> that in his name he would vouchſafe to offer his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne, that was (as he termed him) the deareſt thing that he had, &amp; vpon whom he had founded his greateſt hopes, to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Society of IESVS, who at that time was <hi>Fa.

Therfore the Marques being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous, that he ſhould impart the ſame to his Brother <hi>Rodulfe,</hi> willingly conſenting thereunto, called vpon them to haſten this buſineſſe, and gaue them leaue to draw the writings of renuntiation in what forme they

Therfore the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes were drawne in this forme, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius</hi> renounced all his Fathers dominion, and his rents in fee-farme, which ſhould haue deſcended vnto him by inheritance, &amp; that of all his ſubſtance, he ſhould reſerue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe in preſent, two thouſand crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in ready money, which he might diſpoſe of at his pleaſure, and after that for euery yeare whilſt he liued 400. crownes.

               <p>And that the Emperor might allow of the ſame, <hi>Leonora</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> the Duches of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>VVHILST they ſtand in expectation to haue this abdication authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the Emperour, there fell out in the meane while to the Marques a certaine buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at <hi>Milane,</hi> in which ſeing that himſelfe was not able to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate by reaſon of the goute, he determined to ſend <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> in whoſe prudence &amp; iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17839:78"/>
he repoſed great confidence. Neither was he deceaued heerein. For wheras there were impoſed vpon him many buſineſſes with diuers Princes, he accompliſhed &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched all according to his harts deſire. Going therfore to <hi>Milane</hi> to performe his Fathers commaund, in the ſpace of eight or nine moneths, during the time he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſtay there, he did with ſo great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and dexterity diſpatch theſe affaires, although difficult and perplexed, that they ſorted to the ſame end that his Father deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they ſhould. Neither did he himſelfe at this time reſt voyd of taking ſome fruite. For hauing as we ſaid before finiſhed his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Logicke</hi> in <hi>Spayne,</hi> at <hi>Milane</hi> in the Colledge of <hi>Brera</hi> of the Society of IESVS, proſecuting the knowledge of naturall thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; being of an excellent wit and ſharpe iudgment, he proued therin no ſmall profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. He was daily at the ſchooles both before noone, and after, from which if at any time his buſineſſes hindred him, that which in the meane while was deliuered by the Maiſter, he commaunded to be written out, to the intent that afterward he might ſtudy it at home. He kept diſputations, not only as an auditour, but alſo as a party, either in defending his queſtions, or oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others according to the example of his equals. Moreouer whether he tooke in hand to proue any thing by argument, or to refute it, as there alwayes appeared in him a marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17839:79"/>
ſharpenes of wit, ſo was his modeſty ſo ſingular, that, as it remaineth very manifeſt by his maiſters teſtimony, he gaue no ſhew either in his geſture or ſpeach of any youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full liberty. For which reſpect all carried him both in their eyes, and in their harts.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, he did daily apply himſelfe ſo diligently to a certaine <hi>Mathematician,</hi> whilſt he explicated one Lecture in the ſame Colledge, that, for ſo much as he did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate the ſame, leaſt by little and little he might be ſurpriſed with obliuion, ſo ſoone as he returned home, did to a certaine <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine</hi> of his dictate what he had heard, ſo promptly, ſo clearely, and ſo happily out of his memory, that when that ſame <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,</hi> who at that time was a Library-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhewed me at <hi>Caſtilion</hi> thoſe notes, which euen to this day he preſerueth as ſacred reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, I could not ſufficiently wonder, that he neuer ſo much as omitted any one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that he neither changed the number, the meaſure, the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the point, the line, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that he neuer ſo much as let paſſe any one of thoſe words, with which thoſe writings abound, that were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner proper to this diſcipline.</p>
               <p>He went to the Schoole very modeſtly, with his apparrell of blacke <hi>Florentine</hi> cloth, which they call <hi>Rash,</hi> without any ſword, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, vſing no words euen to his neereſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; for the moſt part vpon foot, although at home he had great ſtore of horſes. One of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17839:79"/>
his ſports &amp; recreations whilſt he remained at <hi>Millan</hi> was this, to conuerſe with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society, &amp; to ſpend a great part of that tyme, which was voyd of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Colledge, ſometime with this, ſometime with that Father in conferring of learning or piety. His maiſter in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> obſerued, that he was wont to diſcours with ſo great reuerence, and ſhew of obſeruance with all religious men, &amp; thoſe which were placed in any ciuill or Eccleſiaſticall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he kept his eyes alwayes deiected, neither did he, vnleſſe it were very ſeldome, ſo much as be hould their face.</p>
               <p>Neither truly was he willing to conuerſe familiarly with Prieſts only, or with them that follow the ſtudy of learning, but with thoſe likewiſe whome they commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly vſe in the ſeruice of domeſticall affaires, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the Porter. And if he did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lend him the keys of the <hi>Gate,</hi> whilſt he went for any one of the Fathers, he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it as a great fauour. Doubtleſſe he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly admitting of this errour, perſuaded himſelfe that he was, euen for this litle while of the ſame Society. And for ſo much as he vnderſtood that euery weeke vpon Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day (if no feſtiuall day fell thereupon) the Fathers of the Colledge, for the exerciſe of their bodies, and relaxation of their mindes from their ſerious ſtudies, were went to go to a certaine Village called <hi>Chilalfa</hi> a mile and a halfe from the Citty, without the <hi>Case</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:17839:80"/>
of <hi>Como,</hi> he by breake of day going into that quarter, leauing his ſeruants for a litle ſpace behind him, walking a while vp and downe either read ſome booke of contemplation, or, being in the Spring-time, gathered vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, til he ſaw ſome Fathers comming that way. Whilſt they paſſed by him he curteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaluting them, followed them ſoftly, and with his eyes, which he continually fixed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, beheld them as far forth as he could in their right way going before him. Surely euen the very behoulding of them, brought him ſo great contentment, as if he had ſeene ſome celeſtiall Angels; and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them moſt happy, for that they had not ſuch hind erances as he had, but that they might freely ſerue God, he deeply ſighed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their courſe of life. As ſoone as they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the Village, he went backe the ſame way, to meet others, &amp; in concluſion came home very much recreated.</p>
               <p>In the dayes, that they call their Carniuall, which by a certaine more lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tious cuſtome are precedent to the Lenten-faſt, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that he might be abſent from the plaies and <hi>Theaters,</hi> and might in the meane while maintaine pious diſcours, he hid himſelfe in the Colledge, often ſaying that the Fathers of the Society of Iesvs, were his ſpectacle, which brought vnto him greater delight then any mortall thing elſe. He ſpake ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly of thoſe pleaſures of vayne men, that clearly it did appeare, how eaſily he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17839:80"/>
could be without them. Once vpon one of thoſe dayes of Carniuall, when at <hi>Millane</hi> there was celebrated a certaine Knight-like exerciſe, with great concourſe of the whole Citty, &amp; eſpecially of the young Knights, and euery one of them were mounted vpon braue ſteeds, and according vnto euery ones ability magnificently trapped, he to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that he might haue the glory of this world in more cotempt, &amp; might ouercome himſelfe, determined to be preſent. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh, as I ſaid before, he had the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund of diuers horſes, wherof one being lead co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with a veluet foot-choth, did for the moſt part follow him, notwithſtanding then whilſt they in this extraordinary manner rid through the thronged ſtreetes, he attended only with two pages, was carried vpon a lowly Mule, ſetting the world no leſſe at naught, then the world did him. This fact of his was very ioyfull, and exemplar to diuers Religious men, who beheld and noted it. In matter of piety he ſtill held his ſolemne cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, neither did he euer omit his vſuall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of holy meditation. He loued to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent places of noted Sanctity, &amp; chiefly the Church of our <hi>B. Lady,</hi> which is called that of <hi>S. Celſus,</hi> being at that time much renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the fame of miracles. Euery ſunday, and feſtiuall day at the Church of <hi>S. Fidelis,</hi> which belongeth to the Society of IESVS, whilſt he addreſſed himſelf to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing of the <hi>B. Eucharist,</hi> he gaue forth ſo
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17839:81"/>
many documentes of a ſubmiſle and deuout mind, that he ſeemed to inſpire religion, and ſanctity into all his behoulders. Verily a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine prieſt who at that time made a ſermon to the people doth affirme, that he, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he deſired in his preaching, to inflame his mind with more plentifull piety, would but turne his eyes toward <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> who was preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alwayes right oppoſite to the pulpit, and moued with his only aſpect, as of ſome ſacred thing, that he was filled with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine celeſtiall ioy. So great euen then was the fame of his Sanctity.</p>

To conclude with what argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts he could, which either his loue, or griefe did ſuggeſt vnto him, he atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted to proue, that if he bound himſelfe in Religion, he would become the blotter-out of his houſe, for ſo much as he being taken away, is was of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be ruinated.</p>
               <p>More ouer he ſet before his eyes how well he was himſelfe accommodated by nature, and nothing flexible to be draw at from the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17839:82"/>
courſe of an honeſt life. That there was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no cauſe why he ſhold doubt to retaine the commodities of Fortune, ſeeing that in the middeſt of them it was poſſible for him to obſerue the courſe of Religious men, and moreouer to moue by his exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple the people which God had committed to his dominion to obey the commandements of God, and imbrace Chriſtian piety. That this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe might open alſo a way for him to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. That he ſhould call to mind how much he was honoured, eſteemed, and beloued of all the men belonging to his dominion; how earneſtly they expected him, and euen as humble ſuppliants lifting vp their hands to Almighty God, did beſeech him, that they might forthwith be committed vnto him to be ruled and gouerned. He reduced likewiſe into his memory, how great fauour he had allready gotten of the Princes, with whome he had both acquaintance and correſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and who were ſingularly well conceited of him. And now he obiected vnto him the feruorous diſpoſition of his brother (vnto whome if he entred into religion he was to reſigne) being in reſpect of his vnripe yeares of no experience, nor as yet fit for gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if he ſhould get the bridle in his teeth, in that headſtrong ſpurt of his youth, that he would become a prey to ſhame and diſgrace. In concluſion he ſayd: <hi>Haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration vpon me, poore diſtreſsed man, afflicted with continuall torments of the goute, &amp; ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17839:82"/>
that I can now ſcarcely wield my ſelfe, who now at laſt haue great need, and truly euen now by thee might be holpen in managing the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome affaires of the Common wealth. But if for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me, you shall goe into Religion, I shall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utroned with buſineſſes, with which being vnable to deale, I shall be oppreſſed with the miſeries both of cares, and ſickneſſe, and you will thus become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to my death.</hi> And hauing ſaid this, his teares guſhed forth in great abundance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terming led with words full of griefe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> who with patience had giuen at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to his ſpeaches, after that he had hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly rendred thankes for the loue &amp; Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care which he had ſhewed towards him, anſwered; that he, truly, had reuolued all theſe things in his mind, or at leaſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of them, &amp; that he was not ignorant what belonged to himſelfe. And that if he were otherwiſe called then by God to this courſe of life, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truly he ſhould not do well, in vndertaking theſe thinges which he had rehearſed, &amp; moreouer he ſhould chiefly be neceſſitated to obey &amp; ſerue his Father, vnto whome next after God he was moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted. That now, ſeing that he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to the courſes and inſtitutes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, by any particular raſhneſſe of his owne mind, but by the inſpiration of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, vnto whoſe calling it be hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to giue eare, that he hoped the ſame God, whoſe Prouidence extendeth ouer all,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17839:83"/>
would prouide, that all thinges ſhould not only ſort themſelues according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his diuine Maieſty, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both for the dignity and profit of his family, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and that they could promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues no leſſe from his infinite goodneſſe. The Marques knowing well, that it was a thinge manifeſt vnto his ſonne, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was giuen vnto him by God, &amp; that was the only cauſe of his ſo firme reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, perceaued, that vnles his mind were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of this perſuaſion, he could neuer be drawne off from his purpoſe. Therfore he made it his greateſt buſines, that diuers men both Religious and Secular ſhould ſound &amp; true his mind, and the inſtinct wherwith he was moued, and that they ſhould draw the young man into the opinion, that he might thinke it agreable to the honour of God, if he ſhould ſpend his life in the gouernement of his dominion.</p>
               <p>All theſe when to pleaſe the Marques, they had day after day, euery one ſeuerally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this courſe of life, &amp; with as much art of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> each as poſſibly they could, laying open the trobles of a Religious life, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to caſt before him terrours, and by other meanes had made triall of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, in fine, confeſſing themſelues to be cleared of all doubt, and ſtanding in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the firme reſolution of the young man, they manifeſted vnto the Marques that this inſtinct ſeemed to be from God, not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17839:83"/>
without enlarging themſelues much in his commendations. When theſe thinges were recounted to the Marques, &amp; that there was ſo great agreement in all their opinions, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that at the laſt he might ſomewhat moderate his deſire of ſearching, whether this was the will of God or no, wheras the Gout ſuffered not him otherwiſe either to goe or ride, he commaunded them to carry him in his chaire to the Church of <hi>S. Fidelis,</hi> which belongeth to the Society of IESVS, and there retiring to a certaine priuate clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, ſending for a Father of great Name in that citty, ſaid vnto him, that in ſo waighty a cauſe, in which was treated the loſſe of his eldeſt ſonne, and that of a ſonne of ſo great worth, he was certainely reſolued to ſtand to his iudgment, and to reſt aduiſed by his opinion. But that he did firſt deſire, that he would queſtion with the young man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe diligently in their preſence concerning that which he had purpoſed in his mind, and that he would take it into mature conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, that he beſought him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the excellency of his wit &amp; learning, that he would vrge all effectuall reaſons that might be to diſſuade him. To conclude that he promiſed as far forth as he was able, to get the conqueſt ouer himſelfe, &amp; wold reſt ſatisfied with that order which he ſhould ſet downe herein. This Father to the intent that he might conforme himſelfe to the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17839:84"/>
Prince in this his requeſt, tooke the matter vpon him, &amp; ſending for <hi>Aloyſius</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them both, began very ſeriouſly to ſound him, ſpent a whole houre partly in queſtioning him, partly in expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer things may be found out either by wit or ſubtility, for the triall and cleare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of the ſpirit of a man, and of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine motions and incitements of his mind. And for ſo much as he had made choyſe of the Inſtitute of the Society, he ſet before him all thoſe difficulties into which it was poſſible for any one to fall, who placed his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon this kind of life. And he acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed all this labour of inquiſition which he had taken vpon him, ſo to the life, that he ſeemed to ſpeake from his very hart; &amp; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius</hi> himſelfe grew ſuſpitious, as after he ſcould me when he was in Religion, that the Father ſeemed not any thing to diſſemble the matter.</p>
               <p>Therfore, for ſo much as he did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide in him, and attribute much to his authority; neyther had there hitherto bene any one, who, as if he had felt his pulſe before hand, did diſcours thereupon ſo ſitly to moue his mind, and as he ſaid, ſo properly; he ſtood for a ſpace with his mind ſuſpended. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in the meane time he anſwered with notable confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to all that was asked him, and ſo clearly diſſolued all difficulties which occurred, not only with reaſons, but alſo with authorities of holy Scripture, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17839:84"/>
learned men, in ſo much as the Father did not only reioyce to ſee him ſo conſtant in his reſolution, but alſo admired to ſee him ſo excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly wel read in the bookes of God and Godly men. After this, ſeing that all his anſweres were ſo accompliſhed, &amp; as it were deriued out of the very bowels of the cauſe it ſelfe, he began to ſuſpect that he had read thoſe thinges that are diſputed by <hi>S. Thomas</hi> in his ſumme of Theology, concerning reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders. Therefore in concluſion he brake forth into theſe wordes. <hi>Aequum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulas (Domine Aloyſi) neque dubium eſſe poteſt quin ſit vt dicis. Mihi quidem stimulos admouiſti, neque vllum preterea quaerendi locum reliquisti.</hi> My Lord <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> it is no otherwiſe then right that you require, neither is there any doubt but that it is as you ſay. Truly you haue moued me very much, neyther haue you left me any ſcope further to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine.</p>
               <p>Theſe words queſtionles did very much recreate the younge man, and did ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that he was of another opinion, then he ſeemed to be, when he for a little while tooke vpon him the perſon of a triall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker. Afterward <hi>Aloyſius</hi> being departed, the Marques freely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed that he was now perſuaded that it was Gods pleaſure it ſhold be ſo, and beginning to rehearſe the whole courſe of his life, ſo piouſly lead from his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cradle, in concluſion promiſeth that he will giue him leaue to betake himſelf to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. A few dayes after this, he goth backe

endeauour to do it by his permiſſion. That, that would altogether be moſt for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, &amp; moſt conducible to him, &amp; the whole Society. It ſeemed good vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius</hi> to follow this Counſell.</p>
               <p>Hereupon going from <hi>Millan,</hi> before he came to <hi>Castilion,</hi> he went to <hi>Mantua,</hi> there partly for the refreſhing of his mind, partly for the confirming of his purpoſe, &amp; corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating his mind againſt that impetuous ſtorme which as he feared might come vpon him, he became deſirous to retire himſelfe to the ſacred Exerciſes of <hi>B.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>incentius</hi> with magnificent preparation, &amp; great honours they were entertained in very Royall manner.</p>
               <p>When therfore there was a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the bordering Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

At that ſame time he was of ſo ſparing a diet, that he could hardly be perceaued to eate any thing.

Which he hath both reſtified to poſterity by ſetting downe in writing, and alſo by his oath at <hi>Nouellara</hi> vpon the inquirv made by order of <hi>Lepidus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rhegio.</hi> For he being there asked whether he knew B. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> to be a young man of a ceraine perfect courſe of life, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with many vertues and ſpirituall guiftes or no? anſwered in theſe very words which I will here ſet downe. <hi>I truly, Syr, not only by the relations of our Fathers, but much better by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne young man of great vertue, whome he made vſe of for his priuate Chamberlaine, for the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down of his lectures, &amp; as it were for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his ſtudies, from whome I was giuen to vnderstand, certaine notable things of the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary punishments which he inflicted vpon himſelf, of his frequent retirement, of the admirable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of vertue and ſanctity giuen by this yonng man. There was likewiſe another more certaine way of informing my ſelfe of him, offered vnto me about that time, vpon occaſion of connerſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with him, and applying my industry in expounding vnto him the ſacred Exerciſes of the Society, in which he (as he ſaid vnto me) deſired
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17839:87"/>
to be inſtructed, to the intent that he might more clearly diſcouer the will of God in the chooſing of a Religious life, for ſo much as the Excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Prince his Father the Marques deſired to be throghly aſſured therof. There it came to paſſe, that in the way of pennance, I tooke the confeſſions of his whole life. Vpon which although I did long, and much pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I could not call to mind any of them, which in my iudgment could be accounted deadly, but that therin appeared certaine arguments of meruelous ſanctity, and of a life ſingularly well lead.

Moreouer in that ſame place, were ſhewed vnto him the <hi>Rules</hi> of the Society of Iesvs, which hauing diligently read, he ſaid, that there was no one of them, from which by reaſon of the difficulty, his mind had any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion.

For as often as he paſſed out of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> he had his eyes alwayes deiected, but only when he ſaluted his retayners, towards whome his courteſy was ſo great, that he went as it were continually with his head bare.

vpon feſtiuall dayes &amp; Sundayes, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he receaued the ſacred <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> he ſpent ſo much time in thanks-giuing, that <hi>Rodulphus</hi> for his recreation, going forth to exerciſe his body, and returning to accompany him home, found him ſtill buſied at his prayers.

But now he had ſo much increaſed his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily corporall afflictions that for very faintneſſe he was ſcarce able to ſtand vpon his legges. In which proceeding it cannot be denied, but that he exceeded all diſcret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and with the ardour of piety was tranſported beyond the bounds of prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But queſtionleſſe thinking himſelfe able to brooke them, he followed the feruour of his mind for his guide, ſeing he was deſtitute of any other. Therfore his mother, both for other reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; chiefly for this, was a meanes to the Marques her husband, that he would giue him leaue to enter into Religion; for that ſhe ſaid, if he ſhould any longer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at home, they ſhould in ſhort time be depriued of him. And that it could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be, that continuing that courſe of life he cold long ſubſiſt.

Verily it fell out as ſhe preſaged.

               <p>At that ſame time, he more earneſtly then euer heretofore, endeauoured to informe

with precepts of piety his Brothers, being euen then of tender yeares, and to teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the manner of praying, which that they might do the more willingly, he rewarded them after their prayers with ſugar-junkets &amp; cheriſhed them with other blandiſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. But of all his brothers, <hi>Francis</hi> ſeemed alwais to be moſt dearey vnto him, who at this day is the Marques of <hi>Caſtilion,</hi> in which principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he ſucceeded his brother <hi>Rodulfus,</hi> the third day of Ianuary, in the yeare of Chriſt 1593. towards whom that loue of <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was cauſed, eyther for that he being now of an age capable of diſcipline, ſhewed forth ſignes of a certaine quiet ſetled iudgment; or for that he preſaged in his mynd (as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) how great a ſafeguard and ornament he ſhould become to his whole family &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.

               <p>NOw, ſome dayes had paſſed, during which time the Marques made no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his cauſe; ſo as he being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirous to diſpatch the buſines determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to grow very earneſt. Therfore taking a conuenient time, with befitting words he aduertiſeth the Marques, that it was now high time to put in execution that which he had deſigned in his mind. Here the Marques perceiuing a neceſſity to be impoſed vpon him, either of granting or denying what he requeſted, deeply ſmothering his inward griefe, denieth that euer he gaue this leaue,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17839:90"/>
and moreouer, that he would not giue it, til his iudgment had arriued to more maturity, and that himſelfe for performance therof was of a more confirmed age, ſuch as is wont to be about the age of fiue &amp; twenty yeares. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> being aſtoniſhed at ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked-for an anſwere, beginneth with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and lamentation to beſeech the Marques by that loue which he oweth to God, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelfe to be preuailed with all, in that which was both equity &amp; iuſtice. But when as he being ſtil more obſtinate, preciſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth to giue way to his intreatyes, and in theſe difficult affaires taketh time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, full of griefe he betaketh himſelf to his chamber to weep. He then tooke this time, to commend the matter to God, &amp; to aske Counſell thereof by his letters of Fa. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: but the Marques maketh ſuch haſt to vexe and oppreſſe him, that wheras he was not able to ſtay for the Generals opinion, he choſe that which ſeemed to be leſſer of two euils. The ſumme of his anſwere was this.</p>
               <p>That although nothing in this life could fall out vnto him more bitter, nothing more oppoſite to the quiet of his mind, then this delay and hindrance of that ſeruice, which he deſired to exhibite to God in Religion, notwithſtanding to the intent that he might be obedient to his Father, vnto whome he was of his owne diſpoſition very deſirous to be conformable in whatſoeuer thinges he lawfully might, and in this very cauſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17839:90"/>
to the commaund of Fa. Generall he ought to be, as far forth as might ſtand with his filiall duty, without offence to God: that vpon two conditions he would ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be delayed from his purpoſe two or three yeares. And that, if one of theſe two might not be admitted, that he would neuer be perſuaded, for the obtaining of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fauour, to incurre the diſpleaſure of God; and, that if he ſhould be reiected by the Fathers of the Society, he had rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Fathers will to wander as a bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed man all the world ouer, then to depart in the leaſt degree from the ſquare of a good conſcience. The conditions were theſe. The one was, that all that time wherin his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Religion ſhould be deferred, he might reſide at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he might both more commodiouſly haue recourſe to Fa. Generall, and apply his ſtudy in learning. The other was that the Marques would now ſend letters to Fa. Generall, by which he wold giue leaue that his ſonne that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt might be admitted into the Society; to wit, that after this, there might remaine no difficulty.</p>
               <p>Theſe conditions being heard, which the Marques perceaued to be aduerſe to his driftes, becomming more angry, when for two whole dayes he had obſtinately refuſed to promiſe the ſending him vpon any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time, or to do any thing elſe, at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouercome with <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his conſtancy,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17839:91"/>
whoſe demaund he ſaw to be no other then iuſt, and vnleſſe he ſhould vndergoe ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe more oppoſite to his liking, he feared to exaſperate him too much, ſuffering himſelfe to be perſuaded, he vndertooke to performe all his requeſts. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately certifieth Father Generall of the whole buſineſſe, relating the conditions which in that couenant with his Father he had obſerued, and with thoſe very wordes he concludes his epiſtle, which might ſerue for an argument, how much griefe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued for the deſerring of this ſo wiſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for a matter.</p>
               <p>During that time, this holy young man euen grew-old with griefe, and with many teares deplored this (as he called it) his ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter fortune, that he was borne in ſo Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious a degree, &amp; that truly the principall amongſt his other brothers. And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he had a holy Enuy againſt thoſe, who being extracted from more obſcure paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, were freed from theſe impediments, which againſt their wils would driue them from the entrance into Religion. But verily that good God, who is wont to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them that mourne, &amp; to looke with pitty vpon them, that inuocate him out of their calamity, cutting-off at one blow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all men, whatſoeuer impediments ſtood betweene <hi>Aloyſius</hi> and the enioying of his deſires, in an inſtant wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away all griefe from his afflicted mind.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17839:91"/>
For after they began to treat of his manner of liuing at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Marques thought that he were beſt to ſoiorne in the houſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Gonzaga</hi> the Cardinall; and he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready intreated the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that he would pleaſe by his letters to commend this matter to the Cardinall, and he in reſpect of his ſingular loue towards <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> had eaſily promiſed to do this office; when I know not what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy ariſing betweene the Duke and the Marques, who ſhould haue the prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in writing, neither of them yielding to the other for certaine cauſes, the matter ſtood ſtil at the ſame ſtay, neyther was there any thing elſe done in it: but that this was the ſpeciall prouidence of Almighty God, was both manifeſt in it ſelfe, as alſo in the free acknowledgment of <hi>Aloyſius.</hi> For if the Duke to pleaſure the Marques, had ſent his letters to the Cardinall, he himſelfe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that for the very receipt of this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, he ſhould ſo much haue engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto him, and ſhould by that meanes haue fallen into ſuch a kind of ſeruitude, that for many yeares after he ſhould hardly haue diſengaged himſelfe from the ſame.</p>
               <p>This determination being diſſolued, it came into the Marques his mind, to place him in the Roman Seminary, ſo that in ſome part therof, deſigned for him and ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as the dignity of his perſon required, being ſeparated from the commerce of the reſt, he might according to the diſcipline of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:17839:92"/>
the Society be inſtructed in good artes, til the prefixed day. But for ſo much at that was oppoſite to the cuſtome of that place, from which euen to that very day no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was euer exempted, ſending vnto <hi>Rome</hi> a certaine man with letters, he laboured with <hi>Scipio Gonza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> a moſt Illuſtrious man, that he would be pleaſed to negotiate this matter with F. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and intreat that they might do this by his permiſsion. He performed very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently whatſoeuer was in his power. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing allegations made vnto him, why this might not conueniently be granted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his opinion, he certified the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques by letters, how the matter ſucceeded. He being not as yet out of hope to obtayne this ſuite, had a determination to exhort <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> that he would intreat <hi>Leonora</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> the Duches of <hi>Mantua,</hi> a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well deſeruing of the Society, to requeſt this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to be done her by Fa. Generall. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius</hi> anſwered wiſely, that this charge wold better befit any other then him. For ſo much as that requeſt was contrary to the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his mind, and to his reputation, as being in poſſibility to moue ſuſpition, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that his mind was altered, or his zeale remitted, eſpecially ſeing that not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſince, in obtaining leaue of the Emperour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his inheritance, he had made vſe of that great womans mediatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore this proiect went not forward.</p>

And eſpecially, when vpon a certaine time for this intent he had beſtowed foure or fiue houres in continuall prayer, he found his mind to be carried, and incited with a certaine inſtinct, that he ſhold go vnto the Marques lying grieuouſly ſicke of the goute, and renewing his ſuite of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſmiſſed, ſhould endeauour all that he could to perſuade with him. He ſuppoſing that this motion was ſent vnto him by ſome peculiar inſtinct of the Holy Ghoſt, goes from his prayers ſtraight to the Marques his chamber, and ſets vpon him very ſeriouſly with theſe very wordes, being indeed very vehement ones: <hi>Equidem Domine pater, in tua me poteſtate fore profiteor. De me statue vt lubet: verumtamen tibi denuncio, me a Deo ad Societa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> IESV <hi>vocatum eſse. Itaque dum hac in re mihi obſiſtis, Dei voluntati obſistis.</hi> Verily my

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo long as in this thing you reſiſt me, you reſiſt the will of God. And hauing ſaid this, ſtaying not ſo much as one minute of time for any anſwere, he ſuddainly ſteps out of the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, leauing his Father grieuouſly wounded with vnexpected griefe.

Therfore with great veneration they beheld him, and confeſſed that euen his aſpect inſpired the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with piety. But the cauſe of his ſtaying ſo many dayes in that Citty, was, for ſo much as it was declared before, in the Inſtrumentes of his abdication that this
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17839:95"/>
was one of the conditions, that during his life he ſhold reſerue vnto himſelfe the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſumme of 400. Crownes, the which he ſhould haue power to diſpend in what he pleaſed, the Marques after he was informed by the Rectour of the Colledge in that Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it was not lawfull for any Religious man to haue propriety in any thing, or to diſpoſe of the ſame according to his owne pleaſure, or to his owne vſe, but that it all belonged to the charge, and care of the Superiour, and that the ſame law was kept inuiolable for the maintaining of the loue of holy pouerty, and that therefore vnto Colledges rentes were allowed only in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, out of which the neceſſities of euery one of them is prouided for; knowing this, he began to be vnwilling to leaue any thing vnto <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> for that he ſaid when he made that condition, his intent was, that the ſame mony ſhould be payable to <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his owne hands; and now that he vnderſtood it was not lawfull by the inſtitute of the Society, his deſire was it ſhould be cancelled. And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius</hi> truly fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no difficulty in permitting this, who nothing paſſed for the forme of the abdication, ſo it might be haſtned, but ſome Lawyers deliuered their opinions to the Marques, that for ſo much as this abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was done by the authority of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, adding this condition therunto, that it was a thing to be feared, laſt that being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the whole might be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17839:96"/>
Whilſt therfore this matter is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and recommended to the diſcuſſion of diuers learned in the law, in ſetting down their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, diuers daies were ſpent; when as <hi>Aloyſius</hi> remained much weary of this delay, he at laſt with great importunity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that likewiſe this other impediment might be remoued, and that an Inſtrument of abdication might be made, withall requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite cautions that they ſhould thinke good.</p>
               <p>That being diſpatched, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember the yeare 1585. at <hi>Mantua</hi> in the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace which takes its denomination from <hi>S. Sebastian,</hi> in which the Marques was preſent, <hi>Proſperus Gonzaga</hi> a very noble gentleman, who was neereſt of kin vnto him, and other principall men whome it concerned, being aſſembled, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> by couenant drawne in forme, releaſeth from himſelfe all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and riches of the Marqueſate. Thoſe great men that I ſpake of before do declare, that whilſt by the Clarke thoſe long inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes were in reading ouer, the Marques by reaſon of that griefe wherewith he was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, was not able to temper himſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weeping: but contrariwiſe <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued himſelfe to haue atteined to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſcope of his deſires, was ſo much taken with contentment, that the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Proſperus</hi> affirmed, he neuer ſaw him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier then vpon that day. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that very ſame day, in the morning, a litle before this abdication was made by
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17839:96"/>
couenant, ſome prime and Illuſtrious men, who in the company of Prince <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>incentius,</hi> who is now Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> had come into the ſame pallace, euen whilſt the Prince co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed with the Marques, became trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> laughing him to ſcorne, for that he would enter into Religion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauouring the moſt that they could, that this renuntiation might not be made.</p>
               <p>The Inſtrumentes being ſealed, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> disburdened of all the cares of his fortunes and dominions, hideth himſelfe alone in his chamber, and throweth himſelfe with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite gratitude before the feet of Almighty God, for that he had now at laſt vouchſafed him this wiſhed treaſure of holy Pouerty. And, in the meane while, his mind flowed with ſo many delicaeies &amp; celeſtiall ſolaces, that afterward he was wont to declare, that he both often at other times, and vpon that day eſpecially, did ſenſibly perceaue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary grace &amp; comfort of God to be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with him. And truly it is a thing much to be admired, that the Marques <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> a Prince ſo renowned forhis liberality, that he was almoſt reputed to be prodigall, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed ſo much parcimony towards his eldeſt ſonne, and ſuch a ſonne, ſo only deere vnto him. Eſpecially, ſeing that he himſelfe was the only man that gaue order, for the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of 400. crownes to his owne proper vſe. I ſhould verily belieue, that God to the intent that he might exhilerate <hi>Aloyſius,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:17839:97"/>
who whilſt he conuerſed in the moſt famous courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> had alwayes ſo great a loue of pouerty, did of ſet-purpoſe ſuffer, that the Marques ſhold incline to that part which was ſo contrary to his cuſtome.</p>
               <p>Hauing rendred thankes to Almighty God, he ſendeth-for into his chamber that venerable prieſt <hi>Ludouicus Cataneus,</hi> whome when he had requeſted to hallow with his benediction, the cloth-garments which he had cauſed to be made priuately for himſelf at <hi>Mantua,</hi> according to the manner of the Society, he ſtrippeth himſelfe of all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane apparrell, and euen of his ſhirt it ſelf, &amp; ſilke ſtockings, and being adorned with that ſacred habit, vpon the ſuddaine he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Parlour where the Princes ſtayed for their dinner. They aſtoniſhed with the newneſſe of the thing; could not with-hould from teares, and chiefly his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Marques, who though long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring, was neuer able all dinner while to keepe from weeping. There <hi>Aloyſius</hi> taking occaſion of this preſent matter, began wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, modeſtly, and very well to the purpoſe to diſcourſe of the occaſions, &amp; dangers of offending the Maieſty of God, with which men plunged in the worlde do combat, of the vaine frailty of the honours of this life, of the manifold difficulties, with which the way of Princes and great men to their eternall ſaluation is incombred, of the care which it is requiſite euery one ſhould haue
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17839:97"/>
for the euerlaſting ſaluation of his ſoule, &amp; this with ſo great authority, and vigour of a celeſtiall ſpirit, that thoſe Noble-men atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto him with great ſhew of reuerence, and piety. And euen vnto this day his ſpeach is celebrated in many mens mouthes.</p>

               <p>THE next day following after this, which was the third before the Nones of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember, he tooke his leaue of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and his Sonne, and ſome other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble women there; and that euening at home, he humbly beſought his Father, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his knees (for his mother was now lately returned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Furthermore in this his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, although he be held all weeping, it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17839:98"/>
is incredible, how ſmall propenſity of mind he ſhewed toward his kindred. To his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother <hi>Rodulph,</hi> vnto whome he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen place in the Dignity of Marques, who followed him in Coach, euen to the riuer <hi>Padus</hi> (where he tooke ſhip for <hi>Ferrara)</hi> all that way and paſſage he ſpake very litle. To a certaine prime man in the ſhip, that ſaid he was of a mind that <hi>Rodulph</hi> conceaued great contentment for that he was inabled to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his dominion, he anſwered: <hi>Non tanto illum ſibi gaudio ſucceſsiſſe, quanto ipſe illi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiſset.</hi> That he did not ſucceed him with ſo much ioy, as he departed with it to him.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Ferrara,</hi> hauing ſaluted <hi>Alphonſus de Este,</hi> Duke of that place, and his wife <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Gonzaga</hi> his kinſwoman, he bendes his iourney to <hi>Bolonia.</hi> He deſired very much in this his iourney to viſit the holy houſe of <hi>Loreto</hi> moued out of a peculiar piety to that place, and alſo with a deſire to performe that vow which his Mother in times paſt made for him at his birth. For although by the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biley that was promulgated, for iuſt cauſes power was giuen them, to make exchange of that Pilgrimage for other good offices, which both of them had already performed, notwithſtanding he determined to ſatisfy that his mothers firſt purpoſe, and his owne ſingular zeale. His determination therfore was, firſt to go to <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> to that great Duke <hi>Francis,</hi> and from thence to turne towards <hi>Loreto.</hi> But when he came to <hi>Petra-Mala,</hi> in

which place being in the confines of <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> towards <hi>Bolonia,</hi> ſubiect to that great Duke, he found, for feare of the plague, a very ſtraite watch kept. There, although his Companions declared both the name &amp; quality of the man, and the cauſes of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking this iourny, notwithſtanding they could not preuaile with them to yield them paſſage. Therfore vpon neceſſity returning to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> from thence by his letters he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelfe to the great Duke, that he could not as he wiſhed tender his duty, and ſeruice to him in his preſence.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Bolonia,</hi> by <hi>Flaminia</hi> he tooke his iourney directly to <hi>Loreto,</hi> whither after he came, it cannot be expreſſed, with how great delicacies God and his moſt Bleſſed Virgin Mother entertained him. The next morning when in that Sacred Chappell, he had fiue or ſixt houres without intermiſsion aſsiſted at the holy Maſſes, he did receaue the Bleſſed Sacrament with incredible deuotion, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly penetrated with recognizing the benefit, which in that place, (where ſo great maieſty and ſanctity harboured) all humane kind had receaued, he became all drowned with teares, neither did it ſeeme poſsible to draw him from thence. But to the intent that he might haue more leaſure to pray and meditate in that holy place all day, he refuſing vnto Fa.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17839:99"/>
togeather with all his company to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Inne. From dinner he returneth to that holy houſe, and for ſo much as it was now diuulged who he was, and with what mind he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> he became remarkable to all, much comforting themſelues, to ſee a young man of that nobleneſſe of birth, and abundance of riches, that with more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry endeauoured to be reduced to an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and needy ſtate, then, for the moſt part, others do hunt after honours, &amp; riches. The next morning following, before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was pleaſed againe at Maſſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with the ſacred Euchariſt, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſome time in his prayers. That being done he went towards <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His courſe of life in his iourney was in a manner this. In the morning ſo ſoone as he roſe out of his bed, for one quarter of an houre he prayed in ſilence, afterward he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Canonicall prayers, which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be ſounge, about the Prime, Third, Sixt, and Ninth Houre, with <hi>Lewis</hi> the prieſt, of whome in this kind of prayer, of which hitherto he had no vſe, he deſired to be inſtructed; he ſaid likewiſe thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which we call the <hi>Itinerarium,</hi> &amp; then he mounted vpon his horſe. Many miles he trauailed ſomewhat remote from all his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſometimes pronouncing the prayers of the daily exerciſe, ſometimes others, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times according to his cuſtome, applying himſelfe to meditation and contemplation.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17839:99"/>
Therefore vpon horſe-backe he was no leſſe attentiue to offices of piety, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others that are ſequeſtred in their chambers. For this reſpect his companions, who well obſerued how much he was delighted with ſolitude &amp; priuacy, vpon ſet-purpoſe, iournied ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance from him. When it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to intertaine talke, ſending for vnto him <hi>Lewis</hi> the prieſt, he conferred with him of diuine matters. Whilſt their horſes tooke their baite at noonetide, he likewiſe tooke ſome ſmall repaſt: afterward ſaying, togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſame Prieſt their Euenſong, &amp; Compline he returned to horſe, and to the way. In the greateſt part therof he reuolued in his mind corporall puniſhments and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, vnto which as he was much addicted, ſo his hope was that beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming a Religious man, he might take his full ſcope in them: &amp; ſometimes he conſidered with himſelfe the affaires of <hi>India,</hi> and the conuerſion of Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, and he was ſet on fire with hope one day to go by miſſion from his Superiour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe coaſts, togeather with others, who in great number euery yeare almoſt, paſſe out of <hi>Europe.</hi> Or to conclude, with other ſuch like cogitations he facilitated his way.</p>
               <p>At the euening in his Inne, although, for ſo much as it was in the ſharpe winter-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he was euen halfe frozen with cold; neuertheleſſe he neuer warmed himſelfe. But ſtraight-way retired all alone into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and there drawing forth, and ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17839:100"/>
his eyes, the picture of Chriſt crucified which he carried with him, throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at his feet, he continually ſpent two houres with God, intermixing ſo many tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, ſighes, groanes, and ſo great ſeruour of mind, that his men, who without doores heard this lamentable noiſe, gazed one vpon another, ſtroken with amazement &amp; harty pennance. Beſides this prayer, he daily for a great ſpace togeather, chaſtiſed himſelfe with ſtripes; and then calling into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Lewis</hi> the Prieſt, he read the Mattines, and Laudes. Afterward he ſate downe to the table, and alwayes abſtaining from meates of a more ſtronger nouriſhment, he ſup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed very ſoberly and ſparingly. He determined to obſerue vpon Wedneſday, Friday, &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday his accuſtomed faſts; but the Prieſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perceaued him to be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the labors of his iourny, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to abſtaine from them. Vnto whoſe commaund truly he was then obedient, but ſcarcely was he come to <hi>Rome,</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke him to them againe.</p>
               <p>When he went to ſleepe, he would nether ſuffer his bed to be warmed, nor his appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell to be taken of. Therfore wheras he was not accuſtomed to weare ſtockings of cloth til the time that he tooke vpon him the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Society at <hi>Mantua,</hi> he was very much trobled euery day with drawing them of. But once when the prieſt taking commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration on him helped him, he ſound his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17839:100"/>
feet and legs almoſt ſtarued, neither euen then wold he make any vſe of fire, although he very much vrged him therunto.</p>

               <p>Hauing ſaluted all thoſe Cardinals whom out of due reſpect he cold not pretermit, he went to the ſeauen moſt famous Churches
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17839:101"/>
of that Citty, &amp; to other places remarkable for ſanctity, to offer vp his prayers with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible piety. Through thoſe wayes which lead from one Church to another, he either meditated diuine matters in ſilence, or ſong ſacred Hymnes; but in the very Churches themſelues, by a thouſand meanes adoring Almighty God, he declared a mind pious, &amp; deuout to his Diuine maieſty. Hauing viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe Churches, he went to <hi>Sixtus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> the Pope, that he might craue his benediction, and deliuer vnto him letters from his Father the Marques.

Being admitted to the Pope, after according to the cuſtome he had kiſſed his feet, he deliuereth the letters from his Father. The pope asketh him many things concerning his intention of entring into Religion, and chiefly whether he had ſufficiently foreſeene that laborious courſe of life. So ſoone as he anſwered that he had long ſince premeditated, and conſidered all thinges, the Pope commending his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and courage of mind, beſtowing his bleſſing vpon him, diſmiſſed him.</p>

The <hi>Maior-domo</hi> of his Fathers houſe he requeſted, that going with his letters to <hi>Ligorno,</hi> he wold in his name ſalute the great
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17839:102"/>
Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi> The Chamberlaine he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that he would preſent his duty to his mother. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Prieſt he beſought, that in his behalfe he would impart theſe words to his Father, <hi>Obliuiſcere populum tuum, &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum patris tui. (Pſal.</hi> 44.) Forget thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the houſe of thy Father: by which he would giue him to vnderſtand, that he fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that very moment, was willing to leaue of all memory of houſe, country, people, &amp; dominion now already deſpiſed by him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked whether he would haue any thing elſe to his brother <hi>Rodulph,</hi> he anſwered, that he ſhould ſay vnto him, that, <hi>Qui timet Deum faciet bona:</hi> he that feareth God ſhall do good thinges. Hauing ſaid this, he left them, very much deploring that they were bereft of ſo good a Lord, and Prince. To conclude, vnto that moſt illuſtrious Patriarch <hi>Gonzaga</hi> who had imployed great induſtry in opening him a way to the Society, with all his hart he yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thankes, and promiſed him his moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent prayers for his ſafety. Heere that good Prelate, who was moued with the ſweetneſſe of his wordes, was not able to refraine from teares, and there profeſſed, that he had an holy emulation towards him, who ſo well knew, how to make choyce of the better part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aloyſius</hi> hauing now diſpatched from him, all both men, and other thinges which eſtranged him from Religion, the mayſter of the Nouices brought him into a chamber,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:17839:103"/>
where according to the cuſtome of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety he ſhould make triall of himſelfe, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then if he had entred into ſome ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Paradiſe, exulting from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of his hart, he made vſe of this ſaying: <hi>Haec requies mea in ſaeculum ſaeculi; hic habitabo, quoniam elegi eam:</hi> This is my reſting place world without end, here will I dwell, becauſe I haue choſen it. And afterward being left there alone, he fell downe vpon his knees, with his mind ſugered with an inward kind of ſweetneſſe, with his eyes bedewed with teares which diuine loue raiſed in them, &amp; gaue humble tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes to God, that deliuering him out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had brought him into this Land promiſed by God, flowing with the milke and hony of celeſtiall ioyes. And then doth he offer and freely dedicate himſelfe to his Diuine Maieſty, as a Sacrifice and Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſt. To conclude, he beſought him to vouchſafe him aſſiſtance, that he might as beſt became him, dwell in the houſe of God, perſeuer, and end his life in exhibiting his holy ſeruice therin. He did not omit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to celebrate that as a feſtiuall day vpon which he entred into Religion, with anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary ſolemnity, &amp; he choſe for his patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Bleſſed <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR ſo much as we haue declared, what a manner of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bleſſed <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was, before he renounced the commodities of Fortune, and tooke vpon him the courſe of a more Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life; time now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that we declare, with what conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and ſanctity he liued amongſt his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, after he was receaued into their nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. At which time, truly, although in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17839:104"/>
he ſhined like a candle, yet for ſo much as he was held within the confines of dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall diſcipline, as a cloſe buſhell, and auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſight of men, leſſe likewiſe did their eyes and mindes reflect vpon his excellent vertue. For that being a very young man, (when he had not as yet finiſhed his ſtudy of Diuinity, nor could not by reaſon of his young yeares be initiated in Prieſt-hood) he dyed: and thoſe few yeares that he liued by the will of his Superiours, that boundleſſe feruour, wherwith before being carried, he had paſſed all diſcreete moderation, was broght to an abſolute and temperate courſe of life. Wherfore vnto thoſe that ſhould meaſure his actions according to a certaine externall kind of apparency, it may ſeeme that after he betooke himſelfe to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of others, omitting thoſe courſes which he made vſe of in his Fathers houſe, he loſt the greateſt ſubiect of his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations: but vnto them that haue bene lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger practitioners in this celeſtiall <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that with the eyes of their mind cleared, and illuminated with diuine light, ſhall behould his religious life, it will manifeſtly appeare, both how great a proficient he was become in perfect vertue, by the guidance of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, and how inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parably thoſe things which he performed in Religion, do in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity ſurpaſſe the actions of his former life. For being now made a Religious man, for ſo much as he was enriched with more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17839:104"/>
knowledge of Sacred matters, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in his working, a certaine more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious kind of light: neither was there any action of his, how litle ſoeuer, which he did not garniſh. both with the combination of many vertues, and with reiecting what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer will of his, that was not altogether correſpondent with the only zeale of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying the Glory of God, and with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ardour of charity towards him.</p>
               <p>But amongſt all that treaſure of his moſt excellent vertues, which we ſhall proſecute in this our ſecond part, we may make obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of two certaine thinges. The one, for that being borne and bred-vp in principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in like manner being of tender &amp; weake health, notwithſtanding ſcarcely had he ſet his foet with in the houſe of the Society, but that he accommodated himſelfe to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cuſtome of liuing, &amp; their domeſticall diſcipline, ſo that he ſemed to differ nothing from the reſt, neither did he euer ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by any of the Superiours, either to be intertained more curiouſly, or to be made ſingular in any thing, although it was often offered him, eſpecially when he came newly from ſo differing a ſtate of life: and in the houſe he condeſcended ſo gladly and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to all, were they neuer ſo abiect &amp; baſe offices, that you would haue ſaid that he to that very day, had neuer bene accuſtomed to other imployments, but to ſpend his time in other mens ſeruice. The other thing was
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17839:105"/>
that from the beginning he perſuaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he might be ſaid to haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med exacty all the rules of Religion, who ſhould omit none of all thoſe, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the holy ordinances of that Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and that ſhould be moſt diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant, in all the offices how light ſoeuer, which are by commaund impoſed vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeuerall day. Wherfore no man could be more obſeruant, no man more vigilant, in diſcouering all thoſe thinges, which either by the inſtitute, or cuſtome are daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. By which meanes he arriued to ſo high a pitch of perfect ſanctity; that worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he may be ſet as a maiſter-peece of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xact and abſolute piety, both before all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men, who aime at any high degree of perfection, and eſpecially before thoſe men that are of our Society. For which cauſe in this ſecond Booke, my purpoſe is, to declare certaine ſmall, &amp; internall matters, that our Brothers may haue from whence to draw an example, in all our domeſticall functions. Therfore in his Nouiſhip it ſelfe he laid his deepeſt foundations of all his vertue.</p>
               <p>For after that, as I determined to relate, he had entred into his firſt Probation, all thoſe dayes that he remained ſecret, his mind tooke great contentment, in reading or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating diuine matters, although for ſo much as his mind was alwayes fixed vpon God, there was in a manner no difference betweene his reading and meditation. In the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17839:105"/>
meane while, whether it were in reſpect of the alteration of the climate, and his diet, or the affliction of his body vpon which he inſiſted, or by reaſon of too much intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind in meditation, his health be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to decline. Vpon that occaſion it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Superiours, to ſend him away ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſooner then ordinary. Which they did ſo much the more willingly, for that hauing of late at <hi>Mantua</hi> vndergone theſe ſacred Exerciſes, &amp; hauing read ouer the Rules &amp; Conſtitutions in times paſt, ſurely he came not altogether ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our affaires. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, truly, hauing bene tried amongſt ſo many aduerſe chaunces, ſeemed it requiſite to try him any further. Hauing finiſhed his probation, he is committed for a litle time to the cure of a <hi>Phiſitian,</hi> til he was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of this indiſpoſition. His linnen which he had worne in his iourney, euen til his comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> when they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen to be waſhed, by the continuall ſtripes wherwith he had daily diſciplined himſelfe, were found imbrued with very much bloud.</p>
               <p>After he was admitted into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of others, the Maiſter of the Nouices obſerued, that he went ſomewhat holding downe his head. Therfore for the breaking him of that cuſtome, or for the exerciſing of a victory ouer himſelfe, he commaunded that his nceke ſhould be incloſed in a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of paſt-bord couered with cloth, to the intent that he might not carry his necke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17839:106"/>
then ſtraight vpward. This when he had bene commaunded to weare for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dayes, he obeyed with meruelous ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, and for that reſpect he pleaſingly ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in company. All the other Nouices he did ſo much obſerue and reuerence, as if he had beene the loweſt of that family. Neither did he long delay, but that he deſired leaue to be giue him, to faſt, to diſcipline, to make vſe of haire-cloth, &amp; other meanes to tame either his body, or his mind. But when he obſerued, that the Nouices, did not vſe, as he hitherto had done, to weare a corner cappe, which is the note of a Cleargy-man, nor their other garments of ſo fine cloth, as that which he had cauſed to be made amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt his friendes, he very earneſtly intreated the Superiours, that they would preſently giue him leaue to weare a hat like the Nouices, and ſuch apparrell as they wore. And this he obtained. Moreouer by their good leaue, he changed his <hi>Breuiary</hi> of Canonicall prayers which was guilded both vpon the leaues &amp; couer, for another more playne one. To conclude, to the end he might eſtrange him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from whatſoeuer might ſmel of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> by degrees he ſtripped himſelfe of all things that he brought with him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. He is exerciſed by God with a certaine penſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and in like manner by the Diuell.</head>
               <p>IT is manifeſt both by the conſent of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers, and alſo by the authority of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17839:106"/>
holy Scripture, that they who dedicate the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the ſeruice of God, and liue fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully therin, are exerciſed, not by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel for puniſhment due vnto any ſinne, but principally by God, that he may ſift &amp; trye them. Therfore God is wont for a litle time to take away from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he endoweth with the light of Diuine knowledge, that celeſtiall ſweetneſſe of mind, which he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to yield vnto them who diligently performe his commaundments. <hi>S. Bernard (ſerm. de Cant. Ezech.)</hi> alleadging in a certaine ſpeach of his, reaſons to this purpoſe, is of this opinion, that this is not done by God v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon cuſtome only, but euen neceſſarily. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God did not long ſuffer his ſeruant <hi>Aloyſius</hi> to be depriued of this kind of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. For now at the beginning he found his mind for a litle ſpace voyd of theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts. At which time he truly was not vnquiet or diſturbed, or more inclined to any kind of vice, but only condoled, that he had loſt that ſweet cheerfulneſſe which euen amongſt his ſecular friendes he enioyed. There remained only one remedy for the mittigating of his griefe, that as often as he gaue himſelfe to prayer, he found himſelfe altogeather eaſed therof. And not longe after, all that clowde of ſadneſſe being driuen away, God, who to the intent that he might trye him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame him with a greater deſire of him, had for a litle while hidden himſelfe, ſhone forth againe vpon his mind, and reſtored vnto him
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17839:107"/>
his accuſtomed peace and tranquility.</p>
               <p>At another time, the Diuell that he might diſcourage his mind, and deiect him, ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted this cogitation: And what I pray you, will the Society do with you? He ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way perceauing that he was ſolicited by the Diuell, made head againſt him, and within the ſpace of halfe an houre obtained the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. He affirmed afterward, that in all the time of his Nouiſhip he was only tempted theſe two times. Therfor after this, his mind was alwayes peaceable &amp; quiet. What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? ſoaring aloft aboue all human chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, he aſſigned all to the Diuine prouidence; by which he ſeemed to aſpire to that place, where he is now, not to be ſhaken with any perturbation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. His constancy of mind in the death of his Father the Marques.</head>
               <p>THIS did he ſufficiently diſcouer to the meſſenger that brought him newes of his Fathers death the Marques <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who dyed ſix weekes after his entrance into the Society. At the hearing wherof, he was no more moued then if it had nothing at all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerned him. Therfore the ſelf-ſame day at the perſuaſion of others being willed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his mother by letters, in ſuch ſort he began them, that he gaue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes to God, for that herafter there was no other cauſe, but that he might ſay, <hi>Pater noſter qui es in celis;</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:17839:107"/>
Our Father which art in Heauen. This ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very ſtrang vnto all, and eſpecially vnto them, who knew very well the entire loue, affection &amp; obſeruance which <hi>Aloyſius</hi> bare towards his Father, which was ſo great, that abſtracting from God and celeſtiall thinges, he denied any thing vpon earth to be more deere vnto him. Verily, he himſelfe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that his Fathers death conſidered of it ſelfe, could not but be a great griefe vnto him: but ſo ſoone as he reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred that it fell out according to the will of God, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that that ſhould ſeeme troubleſome to him which was his pleaſure. And this is which before I ſaid, that he was higher then all Fortune, for ſo much as he wholy depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the will of God. This ſame ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine end of his Father, gaue <hi>Aloyſius</hi> cauſe, to take notice of that extraordinary loue, &amp; ſingular care, that Almighty God had of him. For if the Marques had died two or three moneths ſooner then that time of his abdicating his riches, or that his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Religion had bene deferred but for three moneths, it might well haue bene feared, that either F. Generall, ſuppoſing that, that family ought not to be depriued of ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious a head for the gouerning of its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, would haue deſerred the acceptance of him; or that they of that Prouince accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their inflamed loue towards him, would haue attempted the with-houlding him by force; or at leaſt that he himſelfe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17839:108"/>
to commit this dominion to his yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother being but euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a very child, would haue thought it better, rather for ſome litle time to apply himſelfe to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration therof. But what euent that matter would haue had, that doubtleſſe is beſt knowne to God. Now it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure who had made choice of him, after that being deliuered out of the ſhackles of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he had placed him in Religion, then at laſt to call vnto him the Marques his Father.</p>
               <p>Neither did the ſame prouidence of God ſhew it ſelfe leſſe obſcure towards the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques himſelfe. For wheras he in his youth was much renowned in the war, for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vpon horſe backe, and had ſpent all his time in purchaſing to him, and his, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours &amp; pomps of this world; ſo ſoone as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius</hi> had now betaken himſelfe to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he made ſuch a vertuous alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his manners, and with ſo feruent zeale applied himſelfe to matter of piety, that he became euen a miracle to all his acquaintance. He vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abandoned his gaming, to which heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore he was too much giuen. And euery day at euening, when he had commaunded to be brought vnto his bed-ſide, wherin he ſay ſicke of the goute, that picture of Chriſt crucified which <hi>Aloyſius</hi> had left behind him, before the ſame, togeather with <hi>Ghiſonius,</hi> whome (hauing bene of late <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine) he kept with him, he recited the ſeauen penitentiall <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Litanies:</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:17839:108"/>
Vnto which he ſent for his wife &amp; children, and commaunded to anſwere. In his prayer ſo extreeemely did he weepe, with ſuch deepe ſobs, and groanes that it was an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant teſtimony, of that penitentiall ardour, with which his mind was inflamed. At laſt imbracing the crucifix, and often knocking his breſt, with teares he prayed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>Miſerere Domine, Domine peccaui, miſerere mei:</hi> Mercy O Lord, O Lord I haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, haue mercy vpon me. And being aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at this his vnuſuall promptneſſe of weeping, at laſt he ſaid: <hi>Non ignoro vnde hae la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymae fluant: ſunt hi Aloyſii fructus: Aloyſius à Deo Opt. Maximo, vt hoc ſalutari dolore cor mihi ſuffigeret, impetrauit.</hi> I am not ignorant from whence theſe teares flow: they are my <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> his fruites: <hi>Aloyſius</hi> hath obtained of my good and mighty God to transfixe my hart with this holſome griefe. After this he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and contritely after the manner of a good Chriſtian confeſſed all the ſinnes of his former life, to <hi>Ludouicus Cataneus</hi> the Prieſt lately returned from <hi>Rome</hi> (whither he had accompanied <hi>Aloyſius)</hi> being carried to the Church of the Virgin-mother at <hi>Mantua,</hi> as the ſelfe-ſame <hi>Ludonicus</hi> the prieſt recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto me. Neither did this feruent mind of his euer after decline.</p>
               <p>But ſo ſoone as he perceaued his diſeaſe dayly to increaſe, he commaunded himſelfe to be carried to <hi>Millan,</hi> to trie there whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any remedy could be giuen by the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:17839:109"/>
to his malady. Neuertheleſſe within a few dayes he drew neere his laſt end. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wheras <hi>F. Francis Gonzaga,</hi> being euen them Generall of his order, &amp; by chaunce liued at <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lan,</hi> came vpon a certaine day when he was in great danger, to viſit him, &amp; giue him warning of his death which now neere approached, he himſelfe eaſily ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting what he would haue him to do at that time, of his owne accord requeſted, that he would ſend vnto him ſome one of his order whome he thought moſt fitte, to heare his confeſſion. He ſent one: he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed. The day following the Generall returning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts him to make his will: he made it, and ſetting all thinges in order which were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted herin his lamenting friends, for that he ſaid there was more cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, that it pleaſed God then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund him out of this life, when he was ſo wel min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He departed this mortall life on the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>February</hi> the yeare 1586. His body as he had commaunded being brought to <hi>Mantua</hi> was buried there in <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>Aloyſius</hi> being by the Generall <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> of whome euen now I made mention, &amp; by ſome of his other familiar friendes certified of thoſe thinges that happened at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, much reioycing, gaue thankes to God. He was wont to recount that he was thus taught by his Father: That whatſoeuer man doth apply his mind to, in any courſe of life, or buſines, that he ſhould performe that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17839:109"/>
which he taketh in hand as diligently as he may. That wheras this was his Fathers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in thinges ſubject to fortune, it was much greater reaſon, that he ſhould ſtand ſo affected in Gods cauſe. Neither was he ſlow in ſhewing in his deedes themſelues, how deeply he had imprinted this ſaying in his mind, who did alwayes with inflamed deſire contend, that he might ſubject himſelfe to the gouernement of reaſon, &amp; make good the name and renowne of vertue &amp; Chriſtian prudence.</p>
               <p>And that we may giue a taſt of ſome few thinges, which euen then were both admired and ſpoken of concerning him; firſt of all he ſo vtterly laid downe all care of his kinsfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that he ſeemed euen to haue blotted out of his mind all memory of them. Therfore being asked how many brothers he had, he was not able to giue any anſwere, before to himſelfe he had reckoned their number. At another time a certaine Father asking him, whether he were any thing trobled with the remembrance of his kindred? he denied that he euer had any thought of them, but when he was willing to commend them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to God; and that by the benefit of God, he had his cogitations ſo far forth in his power, that there was neuer any thing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to his mind, vnleſſe he were willing therunto.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of his mortification in the time of his Nouiship; the cuſtody of his Nouiship; the cuſtody of his ſenſes.</head>
               <p>HE had fortified all his ſenſes with ſo diliget a guard, that hauing both eyes &amp; cares, he ſeemed neither to ſee nor heare, and with his body placed vpon earth to be conuerſant with his mind in heauen. Neuer whilſt he was in Religion, was he ſeene to take into his hand, any odoriſerous thing, much leſſe any thing that was perfumed: &amp; as often as in the Hoſpitalls he attended v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po ſicke perſons, which he often asked leaue to do, he applied himſelfe to thoſe that were the moſt loathſome of all others, and he ſo eaſily endured that filthineſſe and ſtinke, that he ſhewed no ſigne of loathſomeneſſe.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe brought-vnder his ſeaſe of touching, by inflicting ſtripes vpo his fleſh, by wearing haire-cloth; vſing often for his daily food nothing but bread and water, &amp; by impoſing vpon himſelfe other corporall puniſhments and vexations. All which he did very frequently vſe, vnleſie in reſpect of his infirme health, he was permitted by his to vſe them leſſe then he would. Neither was any thing more grieuous vnto him, then that in this reſpect he might not follow his owne diſpoſition. Once alſo he did confidently affirme to a certaine Father, that thoſe puniſhments which he now vſed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17839:110"/>
for the repreſſing of the inſolency of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and mind, were nothing in compariſon of thoſe which in his former ſtate of life, he ſuffered of his owne accord. That this one thing was of great comfort to him, for that he knew Religion much to reſemble a ſhip. in which they ſaile, no leſſe, who by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of the Gouernour ſit idle, then they that ſweate in rowing. That day which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of the Church faſt was obſerued, he had obtained of the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Nouices to abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges but bread &amp; water. But the Maiſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlding him when he obſerued that he did eate almoſt nothing that was vpon the table, taking him from that, to the intent that he might miniſter ſome other matter vnto him of ouercomming himſelfe, ſending for him vnto him, he commaundeth him to returne to the ſecond table, and to eate of whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhould be ſet before him. He did as it was commaunded him. But then a certaine man who obſerued it, he being gone from thence, ſaid in ieſt: Surely brother <hi>Aloyſius</hi> you haue taken vp a handſome kind of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, you eate once moderately, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that you may eate againe: vnto whome he anſwered: <hi>Quid vis faciam? Prophet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:17839:111"/>
As concerning his ſenſe of hearing, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer accommodated his cares to them that tould new, or vnprofitable thinges. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if conueniently he might, he turned the ſpeach to ſome other ſubiect: but if he that ſpake were one of any account, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſcouered by his ſilence it ſelfe, &amp; the habit of his countenance, that thoſe things that were ſpoken were diſpleaſing to him.</p>
               <p>Wheras in that his freer courſe of life, as we haue declared before, he did ſeuerely moderate his eyes, he did diſcouer amongſt the Religious, euen much more euident ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes of vigilancy. The Nouices are wont ſometimes euery yeare for recreation-ſake to go forth into a certaine vine-yard. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten had <hi>Aloyſius</hi> gone to the ſame, when I know not vpon what occaſion they were ſent to another. After he was returned home fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, being asked: whether ſeemed vnto him the pleaſanter? he ſaid that he did very much merueile at this queſtion, for ſo much as hitherto he did thinke that it had bene the very ſame; which notwithſtanding did very much differ from this in the way, in lodgings, and other thinges. Calling to mind at laſt, he acknowledged, that in this he ſaw a Chappell, and not the like in the former. When he had now for the ſpace of three moneths taken meate in the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of the nouices, he was yet ignorant of the order which was obſerued in the tables.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17839:111"/>
Therfore being commaunded by Fa. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to bring vnto him a certaine booke which he had left in Fa. Rectours ſeate, he was firſt to be informed, which that place ſhould be, and where the Prieſtes did ſit. At another time hauing likewiſe ſpent three moneths in the nouiſhip, he tould the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that he was troubled with a ſcruple, for that not willingly, but accidentally caſting his eyes vpon a certaine perſon that ſate in his company, he beheld, what he was in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing That he feared leaſt that might ſeeme a token of curioſity, yea and moreouer which you will more wonder at, he added, that this was the firſt ſcruple that had befallen him concerning the gouernement of his eyes, ſince his firſt entrance into the Society.</p>
               <p>He ſeemed altogether to haue loſt his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte, ſo voyd was he in perceauing any taſte in his meate, neither did he any thing care whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were delicate or vile, well ſeaſoned, or vnſauory. It was his only deſire to take the very worſt of that which was ſet before him: and whilſt he was eating to haue his mind alwayes vpon Diuine matters. For but only at that time which he attended to the reading, at noone he mediated of the gall which was giue Chriſt to drinke, at euening of that moſt ſacred ſupper and full of myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherwith laſt of all Chriſt intertained his diſciples.</p>
               <p>He was ſo watchfull in the cuſtody of his tongue, that they who conſidered not how
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17839:112"/>
hurtefull and ſlippery an inſtrument it often is, would iudge him to be but too extreme anxious &amp; ſuperſtitious. Amongſt his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which he vſed as iaculatory in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of his other imployments, euen this <hi>Verſe</hi> out of the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> was very frequent in his mouth: <hi>Pone Domine custodiam ori meo, &amp; oſtium circumstantiae labijs meis.</hi> Puto Lord a watch ouer my mouth, and a ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing doore before my lippes. Alſo he often vſed this ſaying, in the company of men: <hi>Qui non offendit in verbo, hic perfectus est vir: &amp; ſe quis putat ſe Religioſum eſſe non refrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans linguam ſuam, huius vana eſt Religio.</hi> That is to ſay: who doth not offend in word, he is a perfect man: and if any one thinke himſelfe to be Religious, not refraining his tongue, vaine is this mans Religion. And far more contentment was it to him to hold his peace then to ſpeake. Therfore it is incredible, how obſeruant he was of that law, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth ſilence to Religious men for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine times.</p>
               <p>Being ſometimes ſent with ſome prieſt to walke abroad, for ſo much as he had heard, that not alwayes leaue was giuen to talke with thoſe that they went out with, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to read a booke of piety vpon the way, which for this purpoſe he had carried with him, and he ſo paſſed the ſame partely with reading, partely with meditating, that he gaue no one word to his companion; who being delighted with this example, did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17839:112"/>
likewiſe, letting him alone, fall to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But he loued ſilence ſo much eyther for that he feared to offend God, or for ſo much as thoſe celeſtial delights of his mind, which he daily enioyed, vtterly extinguiſhed all deſire of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort which may be reaped by mutuall diſcourſes. Thoſe men that are of the Society, are wont befor they goe out of the houſe to acquaint the porter, whither they goe: wheras therfore the Nouices at <hi>Rome</hi> are wont often to be ſent to the Houſe of the Profeſſed Fathers, eyther to ſerue at Maſſe, or to heare Sermons, or holy Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours vpon feſtiuall dayes, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> asked of his Maiſter, whether he had ſpoken this word in vaine, if (when to be vnderſtood it was ſufficient to ſay he went to the <hi>Houſe)</hi> he ſhould adioyne alſo, that he went to the houſe of the Profeſſed.</p>
               <p>That houre which next after dinner and ſupper, was allowed for the relaxation of their mindes, and which is called the houre of recreation, for ſo much as that time it is lawfull for them to recreate themſelues mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately with ſome diſcourſe; he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer talke otherwiſe then of God, and very often would he breake of his intended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſo ſoone as any thing came into his mind, for which he thoght good to conceale that which he had begun to vtter, &amp; hauing pauſed a while in ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he would neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelfe to be perſuaded to diſcloſe it.</p>
               <p>Alſo as concerning his apparrell, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17839:113"/>
that he might haue thoſe that were the moſt worne, &amp; old in the houſe. When as therfore by the commaundment of the Rectour a new garment was put vpon him, he conceaued ſo much griefe in his mind, that it could not but appeare, both to the tailour and others that were preſent. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſing this his griefe, it was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that that might euen proceed from certaine ſelf ſoue, &amp; a deſire to maintaine his reputation and the opinion that others had of him.

               <p>NOw he applied himſelfe ſo much the more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to thoſe thinges which are wont to be vſed for the repreſſing of the deſire of honour, by how much to men of ſound iudgment, he perceaued that thoſe thinges ſeemed more profitable, and more neceſſary, then the vexation of the body. Therfore in the vſe and practiſe of making himſelfe openly abiect, and expoſed as a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghing-ſtocke to men, he proceeded ſo far, that he made nothing curious of doing it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at home or abroad. Oftentimes he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired leaue to be giuen him to beg almes through the citty, in an old cloke, with his ſhoulder loaded with a wallet. Being asked whether this were any ſhame, or troble to him? he anſwered, no. For ſetting before his eyes the example of Chriſt, and his fauour &amp; the eternall reward which he ſhold deſerue, that they were ſufficient motiues, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe all theſe things, with a mind both wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ioyfull: And truly, if he ſhould euen waigh the matter according to the common iudgment of men, that he could no way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17839:114"/>
how it might ſeeme grieuous vnto him. For ſaid he: <hi>Either I am knowne, or not knowne of them that ſee me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they know me not, I haue no reaſon to paſſe for their iudgment; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that are ignorant of my condition there is no loſſe of eſtimation to be bewailed. But if they know me, beſide this holſome example of mine that they make their profit of, they do not only not diminish their opinion of me, but euen ſo far forth increaſe it, that the greater danger is, that my mind should rather thinke it inſolently to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in, then grieued at. For whoſoeuer, borne to a great fortune, shall for the loue of Chriſt cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe downe to pouerty, shall euen be honoured of them, who themſelues thinke thoſe thinges not to be contemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the ſame manner when vpon feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall dayes in the ſtreetes of the citty &amp; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, by miſſion from his Superiours, he deliuered the groundes of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to beggars, and ruſticks, ſuch was his cheerfulneſſe in performing this office, and tender loue towards all, that both the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort were edified by behoulding him, yea, and gaue Prelates themſelues paſsing by chance, by in their coaches, would ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes with a deſire to ſee, and heare him ſtand ſtill.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion ſixe whole yeares, whome he did not ceaſe to ſolicite, &amp; encourage with the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tement of a Diuine ſpirit, &amp; with ardent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions to exhort, til being inclined to pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

he had brought him to a Prieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of IESVS, who might heare his confeſſion and abſolue him. The ſame office did he often performe to others.</p>
               <p>There was one thing wherin he confeſſed that he was ſomewhat troubled, when open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Refectory, or Pulpit of the Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he was reprehended of his faultes, not for ſo much as he any thing feared to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a man voyd of vertue, which made not any impreſſion in him, but for that as he ſaid, vices were loathſome vnto him.

Nouiſhip, he was of ſo compoſed &amp; ſweet a behauiour, ſo ſparing of diet, ſo much giuen to faſting, ſo apte to ouercome with ſuch ſeuerity both his body and mind, eſpecially when it concerned the contemning of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſo diligently obſeruant of all the rules, were it in neuer ſo litle matters, ſo deſpiſing of himſelfe, ſo affable to all others, ſo much reuerencing his ſuperiours, &amp; ſo obſequious to their commaund, ſo pious, and burning with ſo much charity towards God, laſtly ſo perfect in all the exact rules of vertue, that he was not only extolled in the mouthes of all the Nouices, as a bleſſed Cittizen of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and for ſuch a one, with all obſeruance eſteemed in all aſſemblies, &amp; whatſoeuer he touched, or vſed, they would for piety-ſake honour with kiſſes; but euen they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the Nouiſhip, would earneſtly ſeeke to obtaine thoſe thinges that he had either handled, or vſed, as the reliques of ſome extraordinary holy man.

Rectour, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſpent about three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths amongſt the Nouices. Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund he accepted very ioyfully, for two cauſes, both which had reference to piety. The one was, that by the examples of the Fathers, who hauing ſpent almoſt all their life time in the gouernement of diuers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires &amp; buſineſſes of Religion, do there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the offices, either of the Church and Houſe, or do aſsiſt with their induſtry and counſell the chiefe Gouernour of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety (who keepeth his reſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce there) in the common gouernment; and are of ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that looking into their liues, as a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of religious vertue, he hoped much to aduantage himſelfe thereunto. The other was, that for ſo much as he was very deuout to the moſt ſacred myſtery of the Euchariſt, which alwayes cauſed, that in his Fathers houſe, he willingly ſerued at Maſſe, he did very much reioyce, that he was deſigned by profeſſion to this office.</p>
               <p>But that he was in his mind deuoted ſo much to that holy Sacrament, it was ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all that had any conuerſation with him, that when conſultation was had about making his picture, the deuice of many was, that he ſhould be paynted adoring the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hoſt vpon his knees. His will was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the delightes, and ſoule-raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing fauours, wherewith he was repleniſhed in receauing thoſe ſacred myſteries. Neither ought this to ſeeme ſtrange vnto him, who

Often euery weeke, at certaine ſet-houres he betooke himſelfe to the holy Church, or the Quire therof, and there adored the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſpent ſometime in offering vp his prayers to God. The day before he was to be made partaker therof, that only myſtery found him diſcourſe in all his ſpeach &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, in which there clearely ſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, a certaine diuine and ardent pleaſure, where with his mind was in the meane while repleniſhed. This when it was well perceaued by certaine prieſtes, they did their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, that vpon Saturday before, at thoſe houres that they had leaue to conferre, they

might heare him make diſcourſes, in exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and hidden ſentences vpon this inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable myſtery. And they ſaid that they neuer ſaid Maſſe with more plentifull piety, then vpon the Sunday following. Queſtionleſſe <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his diſcourſes had moued, and ſet on fire their mindes. And this was a thing ſo ordinary, that as often as euen vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day beſides Sunday, any one had a deſire with efficacy and inward guſt, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, or conſecrate the Bleſſed Euchariſt, the day before, he would apply himſelfe. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and of ſet-purpoſe endeauour to fall into ſpeach of this matter. Vpon Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the euening, being poſſeſſed with theſe cogitations, he betooke himſelfe to reſt, vpon Sunday betimes in the morning ſo ſoone as he awaked, he reflected vpon the ſame, then a whole houre did he meditate of the admirable coniunction of the ſoule with God, which is accompliſhed in the Bleſſed Euchariſt. This being done, he went to the holy Church, to heare Maſſe, at which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kneeled immoueably vpon his knees.</p>
               <p>Hauing receaued the Euchariſt, he retired himſelfe into ſome corner, out of which you might ſee him (after he had prayed longe time, being as it were alienated from his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) with ſome difficulty raiſing himſelfe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his feet, with a feeble pace; to creepe out of the Church. But in the meane while he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed a cheerful hart, ful-fraught with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of diuine loue, &amp; celeſtiall ſweetneſſe.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17839:118"/>
The other houres before Noone betaking himſelfe to holy ſilence, he eyther recited prayers to Almighty God, or quietly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plated on him, or piouſly read ſome what committed to writing either by <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>For this reſpect therfore, he ioyfully went to the Houſe of the Profeſſed Fathers, in which he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the diſcipline of the Nouices to be comitted to <hi>Hyeronimus Platus,</hi> a man in vertue and ſtudy of Diuine things, &amp; in the ſcience of all Chriſtian <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> ſingular; witneſſe are his bookes, then a litle before ſet forth, and alſo others like vnto them in argument, which for ſo much as in reſpect of his vntimely death, he could not finiſh, to the great detriment of Religious men, they neuer ſaw the light. In theſe with an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble methode &amp; order he ſet downe a courſe how to abſtract the mind from the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full illuſions of fortune, how to tame &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate a mans body; how to bridle all the motions of the mind, and ſet them in order; how to extirpate all vices and vicious habits; how to get all vertues neceſſary for a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, both to gouerne himſelfe &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with others: to conclude, how with perfect charity to ioyne himſelfe with God. Hauing now finiſhed but two bookes, death bereauing vs of him forced him to leaue his worke vnperfect.

deliuered ouer to his charge, according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that opinion, which from the very firſt day of his acquaintance with him, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued of him, he was very glad.

ſide from a principall Marques, not far from the dominion of</hi> Mantua, <hi>to the Duke wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is very neare allied, and vpon him as being the eldest of that ſtock, relied the next hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion. But ſo ſoone as it pleaſed God to chalenge him to himſelfe, about ſome two yeares ſince, when he liued in the Court of</hi> Philip <hi>the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>King, he addicted his mind vnto the Society, &amp; plainely manifeſted the ſame vnto his Father the Marques, who himſelfe likewiſe remained in that Court. He after many trials made of him, at last yielded his conſent, and not long after retourning out of</hi> Spayne, <hi>wrote to</hi> Scipio Gonzaga <hi>a most Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious man of his kindred, who at this day is</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>of</hi> Hieruſalem, <hi>that he would be pleaſed to deale with our</hi> F.

Yet neuertheleſse this whole matter being effected, when this good young man was in hope shortly to land at his wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed hauen, his Father was his only obstacle, who either out of his vehement loue toward him, or out of the hope which he repoſed in him, or, as he now writeth to</hi> F. Generall, <hi>for that he thought his age as yet vnripe for the vndertaking of ſo great a matter, ſuffered not himſelfe to be perſuaded, to giue conſent for his going, and purpoſed to haue delayed him ſome yeares more. But here the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:17839:119"/>
constancy, and feruorous mind of this young man diſcouered themſelues. For although he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his Father with inexplicable obedience, not withstanding he ſought infinite wayes to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite him, and incline his mind; and when he could not obtaine at his hands, this his good, and iust ſuite, verily he ſent vnto</hi> F. Generall <hi>his moſt ardent letters, wherby he beſought his fauour, that he might come vnto him without euer taking leaue of his Father. VVhen the Generall denied this, the matter was deſerred euen til this time. But now, by what art, I know not truly, hauing doubtleſſe at last obtained leaue, in Eccleſiasticad habit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with about ſome ten horſe-men, he came to</hi> Rome. <hi>His arriuall was ſo published, wherſoeuer he made his iournies, and euen at</hi> Rome <hi>thoſe few dayes, that he remained in the houſe of</hi> Scipio Gonzaga, <hi>it was already bruted abrode, that he came to enter into Society, that when about the ſame time, he went to the Popes Holineſſe, that by his benediction he might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified for the proſecution of his intended enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, his intention being noiſed throughout the Court, he was enuironed with a ring of ſuch kind of perſons, who for ſo much as their chiefest cares and ambitions infinitely differed from his, came to gaze vpon him like ſome monster. To conclude, the next day after, being munday, which as I ſaid was dedicated to</hi> S. Catherine, <hi>he betooke him to</hi> S.

Thoſe that are of the ſame houſe with him declare, that he applieth himſelfe to meditation foure or fiue times in the day: and that he doth as often in the night, but they haue no certainty what partitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he maketh of his time, for that now a good while ſince he would ſuffer no one to help him to bed, but being shut vp in his chamber, according to the proportion of his ardour

and piety, he gaue himſelfe ouer to the offices of a deuout mind towards God.

not as yet inwardly acquainted with him, yet euery one vnderſtandeth with how mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent praiſes he extolleth him.

But then eſpecially, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with a certaine Father of celeſtiall beatitude, he affirmed that the inhabitantes of Heauen, who are poſſeſt therof, do ſo far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth accommodate themſelues to the will of God, whome they know and behould, that they do after a certaine manner paſſe into him, in ſuch ſort, as that they neyther loue, nor will any thing but that which God loueth and willeth; he added that it ſeemed vnto him that there appeared an example herof in our <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> in whoſe mind, ſaid he, when thoſe heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Cittizens ſee God moſt pleaſingly to reſt, they likewiſe obey this his diuine will, and imploy themſelues ſo wholy in adorning him with immortall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and guiftes, in ſtoring him with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

would hardly be brought, willingly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to the power of a man, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he had neither parity in birth, nor in the guiftes either of nature, or fortune: but that it is a thing the moſt glorious of all other, to ſubiect a mans ſelfe to God, or which is all one, to him that repreſenteth God.

When he performed the part of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he was conſiderate in reading, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing haſty.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that after dinner and ſupper, he ſhould not only ſpend one houre, as he was wont, but that he ſhould moreouer for the ſpace of halfe an houre, togeather with them that tooke their refection at the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, recreate his mind with diſcourſe. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had taken his refection at the firſt table, fulfilled this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund. But the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter being ignorant of this, finding him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that recreated in the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth him openly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his fault in the refectory &amp; to do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for breaking the rule of ſiléce, beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the appointed houre which next inſued the time of his meale. He performed that which was impoſed vpon him by way of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, making no excuſe, nor ſo much as euer mentioning this commaund giuen him by
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17839:124"/>
his ſuperiour, and ſtraight-way according to his ſuperiours firſt commaund he went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to make himſelfe partaker of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond recreation. That being diſcouered, the Miniſter was ſtroken with admiration; and afterward reiterated his pennance, neyther doth he withſtand, or alleage any cauſe to the contrary. After refection <hi>F. Platus</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for him, admoniſheth him, that he had offended againſt his fellowes, for that being but yet a Nouice, he had beene admoniſhed twiſe for one fault. Moreouer he asked him, why he had not made knowne to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that he did it by leaue from his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour? He anſwered, that it came likewiſe into his mind, that peraduenture his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing therof, might become an ill example vnto others, but that he feared, leaſt that ſelfe-loue might deceaue him, in alleadging as an excuſe, that leaue and commaund of his ſuperiour wherby he was free from that rule, that he perſeuered, paſſing ouer the matter with diſſimulation, that he did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe pennance once againe, and that if afterward the Miniſter had moued any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leaſt he might offend any one by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement, that he would haue diſcloſed the commaundment, that had bene impoſed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him.</p>
               <p>This was of great force to inkindle the minds of others, to ſee with how prepared and patient a mind he ſuffered pennance, with how great alacrity he vnderwent what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17839:125"/>
penalty, although vndeſeruedly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon him, either for any fault or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence of his, which two were neuer, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldome found in him. Yea and very often it fel out, that for that which others had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in, he being by ſome miſtake accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, would willingly, and without making any allegation for himſelfe, euen as if he had bene culpable, ſuffer the pennance. But this did not long lye hid, for ſo much as they that were in fault, when they ſaw him do pennance, with a kind of ſubiecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, would make open profeſsion of the fault committed.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the day, he was wont to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſome one Father, to the priſons or Hoſpitals, whither it is the cuſtome of the Prieſts of that houſe, that are imployed to that purpoſe, often euery weeke to go; &amp; in the meane tyme, whilſt the Prieſt beſtowed himſelf amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the priſoners or ſicke perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that made their confeſsions to him, he wold inſtruct the reſt, of the points of Chriſtian fayth, or of the manner of accompliſhing the Sacrament of pennance. When he remayned at home, he buſied himſelfe in ſweeping of the houſe, and other ſuch like humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices. When vpon a time, togeather with his fellowes, he foulded vp certaine linnen in the garret, which being brought from the waſhing place was dried there, it came into his mind, that he had read nothing that day in <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> as he was daily wont to do.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:17839:125"/>
Therfore after a litle while he had done that thing which he was about, he was deſirous to ſatisfy his piety. And it was lawfull for him truly, as likewiſe for the other Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo ſoone as they had beſtowed ſometime vpon that kind of worke, without blame to depart. But he laid downe this deſire, after he had anſwered his cogitations in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>D. Bernardus, ſi eum legeres, quid aliud te do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret quàm obedientiam? Fac igitur iam te legiſſe, &amp; obedientiam adhibe. S. Bernard,</hi> if thou ſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt read him, what other thing would he teach thee, but obedience? Imagine therfore that thou hadſt already read him, &amp; practiſe obedience.</p>
               <p>He did ſo carefully obey all the rules of how litle account ſoeuer, that for no mans ſake of what dignity ſoeuer he was, would he tranſgreſſe them. This appeared, when the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Cardinall Roboreus</hi> his kinſman, comming into the Veſtry of the Church, to ſee him, he excuſing himſelfe, ſaid it was not in his power to ſpeake with him. With which excuſe he being very well pleaſed, would haue no ſpeach with him till it was permitted by <hi>Fa. Generall.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſo perfect was he in the punctuall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his duty, of ſo vpright and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome an example to all, that all that were in that houſe lodged him in their boſoms, and reputed him for a very holy you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g man. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſpent two moneths there, he is recalled to <hi>S. Andrewes.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. X. How he ſpent the reſt of the time of his Nouiship, The purity of his mind; and moderation of his Affections.</head>
               <p>ALOYSIVS being returned to the houſe of the Nouiſhip which is at <hi>S. Andrews,</hi> and hauing very much profited in the courſe of vertue, by the excellent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Fathers which he had ſeene in the houſe of the Profeſſed, firſt of all gaue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Maiſter of the Nouices, of all thinges which had paſſed inwardly in his mind, during the time of his abſence, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a more ſeruent mind, and care then euer hertofore, he gaue himſelfe to the exerciſing of the Nouices functions. And ſo well and carefully did he performe euery point of his duty, that not only others were able to conuince him of any fault, but euen he himſelfe truly, who was wont moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to obſerue all his owne affaires, and not only to ſift-out all his actions, but his cogitations themſelues, cold find nothing in himſelfe worthy of reprehenſion. That diſcouered it ſelfe very plainely, when vpon a time he propounded vnto the Maiſter of the Nouices a certaine ſeruple to be cleared, which did very much exerciſe him, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that although he had imployed all the diligence that he could, in the narrow ſearch of his mind, he could not find any thing in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17839:126"/>
the ſame, that might amount to a veniall ſinne. And that this was it, which did very much afflict him; for he feared leaſt this came to paſſe, out of the ſmall vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that he had of himſelfe, and leaſt by this meanes, thoſe inward darke miſts ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſhaddow his mind, which he had often heard of, and truly alſo read of, that might expoſe him to very much danger. And by this, how great the purity of his mind was, may eaſily be gathered. To this were a great help, the many endow me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of his mind, ſome of which I purpoſe to declare in this place, leaſt it may ſeeme a thing incredible to ſome, that he could poſſibly maintaine ſo great integrity &amp; cleaneneſſe of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all by daily induſtry, which from his very firſt childhood he had beſtowed, in ſubduing the affections of his mind, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hauing gotten an habit, had now arriued to that perfection, that neither his mind ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be diſturbed, nor moued with any ſenſe of mortall things, no not ſo much as with the firſt motions of any inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Surely very many with whome he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed when he was in Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue teſtified vpon their oath, that they haue beene ſo far at any time from finding him in any errour that might beare the ſhew of a veniall ſinne, that he neuer ſo much as diſcouered any the leaſt ſigne of a mind ſuddenly, or without the diſcourſe of reaſon, ſtirred either with anger, impatience, or any other diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17839:127"/>
Which immunity from all inſolent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, is ſo much the more to be wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, for that, as we ſaid in another place, it proceeded not from any dulneſſe of nature, as who, beſides that he was now in his youth &amp; of a hoat ſanguine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexion, was of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and perſpicacious wit, aboue the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his age. But queſtionles this is to be aſcribed to the ſpeciall grace of God, &amp; the habits of excellent vertues, vnto which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall meditation, and exerciſe of bridling and reducing himſelfe to the ſquare of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and celeſtiall doctrine, had broght him. This alſo may be added, that in all his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he followed not his affection as a guide, which often times precipitates a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beyond the bounds of reaſon, but the light of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident mind. Therfore he ſaid, he that is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by his paſſions, is ſubiect to many errours.</p>
               <p>Neither truly in the meetings, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his fellowes, would he euer, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of victory, deſcend into any vaine ſtrife of words, but hauing ingenuouſly declared what his opinion was, if there were any one that contradicted him, he reſiſted him not, vnleſſe ſometimes he thought good to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were ſomewhat, in a mild manner, with plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſpeach, and a peaceable mind, for the patronizing of truth: but if the other perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in a contentious manner, he held his peace, as if the matter had nothing at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:17839:127"/>
Moreouer, he did moſt carefully reiect not only euery indifferent deſire, but which is more, euen euery good and holy one that might neuer ſo litle diſturbe the calme, and quiet ſtate of his mind, and awake any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous cares. Wherfore his mind alwayes enioyed a certaine perpetuall reſt and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, which by continuall vſe he had now in a manner turned into nature. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more it was a helpe vnto him, then which none could be greater, for ſo much as he did not only put before the eyes of his mind, Almighty God daily in all his actions (for whoſe ſake there was nothing that he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, in which he did not labour with all poſsible diligence) but alſo for that he was conſociated with him by perpetuall vſe of prayer.</p>

trobled &amp; vnquiet motions, that irkeſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of themſelues, he attributed to their neglect of the cuſtome of ſacred meditation and prayer.

               <p>He did admire and commiſerate the ſloth of ſome men, who when being buſied in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary imployments, haue had by chaunce ſometimes no leaſure to meditate according to their holſome cuſtome, do by degrees take vp a habit of intermitting this diuine exerciſe, euen when they do moſt abound with time and oportunity. But he had ſo, with his whole affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giuen himſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, that the ſumme of all his delight ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be compriſed in that time which he applied to prayer, or meditation. And by thoſe thinges which he had found in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by long vſe, he gathered many very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent precepts of the right courſe of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Therfore <hi>F. Robert Bellarmine</hi> (who is now in the number of the Cardinals) when in the Roman Colledge he explicated to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſtudents there, the Chapters of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, deſcribed in that little Booke of ſpirituall exerciſes of the Society, hauing deliuered any excellent docume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditating, was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to adde, that he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this of our <hi>Aloyſius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:17839:128"/>
He prepared his mind very dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for a quarter of an houre, or at the leaſt for halfe a quarter of an houre, certaine pointes which the next day after he would meditate vpon. So ſoone as it was day in the morning, he did his endeauour, that he might be prepared for meditation, a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they rung to the beginning therof. In which time, he laboured to compoſe his mind being recollected to a calmeneſſe, and to free it from all care, &amp; whatſoeuer other inordinate deſire. For he ſaid, that it could not poſſibly be, but that the mind ſhould be otherwiſe ſet on worke, and refuſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in it ſelfe the image of God, vnto the ſimilitude wherof he ought moſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him in meditation &amp; contemplation, whilſt in the meane tyme it is inthralled with the ſolicitude, loue, or deſire of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. I do remember that I haue heard him, when to that purpoſe he made vſe of this ſimilitude: <hi>Euen as the water being wafted with the wind, doth, either by reaſon that it is tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, not shew at all the shape of that man that sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth by it: or if it be cleare it doth not shew all the members continuate with the body, but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth them as it were ſeuerally cut in ſunder, &amp; diſſeuered: ſo he ſaid, that a mans mind, who in his contemplation combateth with contrary blasts of perturbations, or is turmoiled with affections and deſires, can by no meanes be aptly or rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, to preſet the image of God, or conceaue any ſimilitude of ſo great a maiesty, as he meditateth vpon.</hi>

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:17839:129"/>
The bell to prayer being rung, with as great reuerence as he poſſibly could, he fell vpon his knees in his poore oratory, &amp; with ſo great induſtry of mind, leaſt he ſhould be diſtracted with any other care, did he watch ouer himſelfe, that for this reſpect he would not ſo much as giue way to the neceſſity of ſpitting. He gaue himſelfe wholy to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of thoſe things that he had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to meditate; and his vitall ſpirits, togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his bloud reſorting vpward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his higher parts, through the intenſiue working of his mind, ſo great a debility &amp; cold ſurpriſed his neather limbs, that his prayer being ended he was not able to ſtand vpon his feet. Often likewiſe it happened, that after he aroſe from the ſame, his mind being for ſometime alienated from his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he did not ſo much as know the place that he ſtood in. Which then chiefly came to paſſe, when he conſidered in his mind thoſe attributes of God, as, his goodneſſe, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, loue towards men, &amp; principally the infiniteneſſe of all theſe, for then was he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt abſtracted from his ſenſes. In his prayer he had ſo great a guift of teares, and powred them out ſo largely, that it was neceſſary his Superiours ſhould take ſome courſe to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate them, for feare leaſt by their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance his head and eyes might receaue ſome detriment. But by no remedy, could they euer preuaile.</p>
               <p>But that which is moſt admirable, of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17839:129"/>
which both others who tooke his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, &amp; alſo <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> is witneſſe, that his mynd was neuer wont to be any whit diſtracted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his determinate prayer: which how great a guift of God it is, euery one may eaſily coniecture, by that which he himſelfe experienceth in his owne prayers. This ſo certaine power of bending his mind vpon holy matters, he did not only obtaine by Gods fauour, but by this likewiſe, that by long meditation, and vſe he had made the force of his mind euen ſo prone &amp; obedient vnto him, (wherby he comprehended and painted liuely in his cogitation euen thoſe thinges that were a far of) as that there was nothing, but what was accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his purpoſe, that euer came into his mind. And vpon that cogitation which he had vndertaken, ſo earneſtly in the time of his recreation, did he fixe his mind, that he neuer reflected vpon that which others ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did or ſayd, and therupon he neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred any danger of diuerting his mind by any thing whatſoeuer. And although in the houſe of the Nouices, and in a manner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that example, in the Colledges, all the lodgings are peruſed, wherby it may be diſcouered, whether all according to their appointed houres, be at their prayers or no, notwithſtanding ſo long as he liued in Religion, he neuer perceaued any one that came in this manner to behould him. Which is a notable ſigne truly, how far at that time
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17839:130"/>
he was remote from all ſenſe, and how at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to his meditation.</p>
               <p>It is decreed by a rule, that euery one of the Society, both at the time of his firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance as a Nouice, and all his life-time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, euery ſixt moneth to diſcloſe to his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour not only his ſinnes, but alſo the giftes, graces, &amp; vertues which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Almighty God, &amp; to conclude all the ſecrets of his conſcience: which is to the intent that he, whoſe part it is to gouerne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with his Counſell, hauing by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes an vnderſtanding of all, may in a Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, reſtraine thoſe that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this was that, wherby many of <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> his vertues were laid open. For out of a deſire to obey this rule, &amp; to direct himſelfe according to that preſcript of his ſuperiours, he did with great candour &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity detect vnto them, and thoſe his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a better life, how God behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his hart. That muſt be very diligently obſerued, leaſt it may ſeeme ſtrange vnto any one, that he declared very many of his vertues. For his deſire of obeying his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and this rule, brought him vnto this, being accuſtomed otherwiſe to ſpeake very ſparingly of himſelfe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as therfore once
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:17839:130"/>
he gaue account to the Rectour of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate of his mind, who asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in prayer he were not ſometimes diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in his cogitation to other matters? he anſwered ingenuouſly: that if all his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagant cogitations, which within the ſpace of thoſe ſixe moneths, had hindered his mind, either in prayer, meditation, or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining his conſcience, were put togeather, that all thoſe impediments, would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to the time, that one might recite one <hi>Aue Maria</hi> in.</p>
               <p>In his vocall prayers that depended vpon his pronunciation, he found greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not truly for that in thoſe his mind wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered vpon any other matter, but becauſe he could not ſo readily, &amp; fitly apprehend the meaning of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> or other things which he recited. Therfore he ſaid that then the caſe ſtood ſo with him, as it doth with a man that ſtandeth before doores that are ſhut againſt him, who neither could enter in, nor would goe any whither elſe. But that otherwiſe in this kind of prayer alſo, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with exceeding great ſenſe and pleaſure of celeſtiall things; eſpecially in reading the Pſalmes, by which he put on certaine pious affections of mind, wherwith they are plentifully ſtored. Which truly ſometimes were ſo earneſt, that ſcarcely, &amp; not without ſome violence he vttered his words. Therfore when according to his pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he had a cuſtome to recite the Canonicall
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17839:131"/>
prayers in the time of his Nouiſhip accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of the Prieſts, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in his Mattines at the leaſt a whole houre.</p>
               <p>As for that which belongeth to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of meditation, he did very much inſiſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the conſideration of the torments, and bitter paſſion of Chriſt our Lord. and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped therby diuine conſolations. The memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therof he daily renewed by pronouncing at noone a certaine briefe Ant-hymne, &amp; by thinking vpon Chriſt crucified. Which he performed with ſo cleare ſenſe of piety, and attention of mind, that he ſaid, he daily had before his eyes manifeſily, the ſanctity of that time, which vpon good Friday in holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeke is ſolemnized. How much ſpirit, and celeſtiall ſolace he reaped by meditating on the ſacred Euchariſt, hath bene ſpoken of heretofore. He worſhipped with a certaine ſingular obſeruance, and gladly meditated vpon, the holy Angels and eſpecially his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell-guardian. At which time how notable ſentences Almighty God ſuggeſted to his mind of thoſe incorporeall ſpirits, witneſſeth that his no leſſe long then elegant medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Angells, which <hi>F. Vincentius Bruno</hi> hath reduced into the ſecond part of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and Doctour <hi>Andreas Victorellus</hi> hath very commendably cited in his learned booke, Of the Cuſtody of Angels. Which truly, wholy, as well the words as ſentences, is <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> his ofſpring. For <hi>Father Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:17839:131"/>
himſelfe declared that he, for ſo much as he was not ignorant, that <hi>Aloyſius</hi> bare a particular deuotion to the holy Angells, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured vpon ſet purpoſe, that he ſhould ſet downe in writing what his opinion was of them. There is vnder my cuſtody a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſheet of paper, written by <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> his owne hand, which of late I found amogſt others, in which diſtinctly he noteth theſe things of the Angells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certaine offices of piety towards the Angells in generall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Imagine your ſelfe to be ſorted amongſt the nine quires of Angels, mutually praying vnto God, and ſinging that Hymne:</hi> Holy God, Holy and Powerfull, Holy and Immortall haue mercy vpon vs: <hi>which Hymne moreouer you shall nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times iterate, and ioyne your prayers with theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To your Angell-keeper you shall chiefly three tymes in the day commend your ſelfe. Morning and Euening reciting this prayer,</hi> Angele Dei, &amp;c. <hi>and about the mid-tyme of the day when you betake your ſelfe to the holy Church, to offer vp your prayers before the Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perſuade your ſelfe that you ought in the ſame ſort to follow the conduct of your Angell, as ſome blind man who being ignorant of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of wayes, confideth in all things to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of him that leadeth him by his staffe.</hi> Theſe were the very wordes of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, it ſeemeth a thing that may be very truly confirmed. That his Religious life was no otherwiſe, then a certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17839:132"/>
practice of prayer. For by reaſon of the vſe of ſo many yeares prayer, and abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of his mind from his ſenſes, he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch a kind of habit, that herſoeuer he was, what thing ſoeuer he did, his mind was rather vpon thoſe things which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued only with his vnderſtanding, then v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thoſe, that he apprehended with his ſenſes.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay? he was now come vnto that ſtate, that he ſcarcely made vſe of his ſenſes themſelues as of his eyes for ſeeing, or of his eares for hearing; ſo wholy had he turned himſelfe from them to the inward parts. In theſe only he repoſed, theſe were his delightes, from theſe if the reſpect of any profit did withdraw him, although he put in execution all things which the matter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, notwithſtanding he was as much tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in mind, as if ſome one of his limmes had bene our of ioynt. Wherfore nothing was more eaſie vnto him, then to be all the day, with his cogitation fixed vpon God, though it were euen in the middeſt of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occupations, to haue his mind recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and to hould it ſtill to one &amp; the ſelfe, ſame object, nothing more difficult then to diſtract it. Verily he himſelfe once confeſſed, that how much difficulty others haue (as they themſelues ſay) to fixe their minds v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon God, he had no leſſe in recalling it from God. For ſo long as he endeauoured to countermaund his thinking vpon God,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17839:132"/>
he combatted with vehement force, ſeing that he was neceſſitated to wraſtle with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. With which violent &amp; impetuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, he more impaired his health, then with his daily conſideration it ſelfe of God. In the day time, though he was neuer ſo much intangled in buſineſſe. God neuer abſtained from repleniſhing his hart with very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full delectations, and thoſe truly not ſhort, but ſuch as continued ſometimes more then an houre. Which verily did ſo fully poſſeſſe his mind, that redounding into his body, did enkindle it with a certaine celeſtiall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, which did ſufficiently diſcouer it ſelfe by the very redneſſe of his countenance. And ſometimes his hart, being ſurpriſed with that ioy, did with ſo thick and ſpeedy a motion pant, &amp; appeare ſo plainely throgh his breſt, that you would ſay it would euen leap forth.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſo many internall ioyes, with which his mind was nouriſhed, had ſo bereft him of all care of his body, that he began euery day more and more to be weakened and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and the griefe of his head which ſhould haue bene mitigated, grew greater. When therfore his ſuperiours, that had the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of him, obſerued that it could not be, that in ſo much vehement labour of mind, he could long continue with life, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially his health being hertofore diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with voluntary afflictions, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him all vſe of faſting, abſtinence, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plining,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:17839:133"/>
and all other ſeuere puniſhments: moreouer they enlarged the time of his ſleepe, and contracted that of his prayer, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king firſt away halfe an houre, &amp; afterward alſo the whole houre; for bidding in like manner the frequent cuſtome of thoſe his ſhort prayers which he was wont to vſe in the diſpatch of his buſineſſes; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude denouncing vnto him, that how much leſſe time he ſpent in prayer, ſo much the nearer ſhould he come to the will of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours. Beſides this, to the intent, that he might be the further ſequeſtred from his mentall meditations, they endeauoured to detaine him in diuers manuall workes, and finally to procure by frequent admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to perſuade him, that how much the more diligently for his healths ſake, he tempered himſelfe, ſo much the more he added to Gods glory.</p>
               <p>Neyther was there any great difficulty, to induce him to be of this mind, and to frame him after their owne wills, as who was moſt obedient &amp; ready vnto all things. This that he might clearly make ſhew of, this chaunce happened. A certayne Father had brought him into hope, that he would obtaine for him of Fa. Generall, that he might dayly ſpend one houre in meditation, which as I ſayd, was forbidden him by the Mayſter of the Nouices. He when he perceaued him to be ſomewhat too deſirous of this leaue, and feared leaſt that being not obtayned, he
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:17839:133"/>
would be much troubled, ſuppoſing that this too much vehemency of mynd, was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite both to that moderation and equality of diſpoſition, which ſubiects ought to haue towards their ſuperiour, as alſo to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund which was impoſed vpon him; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly did his endeauour, to worke him off from that conceit, &amp; reduce him to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tranquillity and indifferency. That one thing moſt gauled him, that he did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently perceaue, how it might be in his power to performe the commaund of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. For although he laboured, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert his mynd from the cogitation of diuine matters, notwithſtanding by ſtealth, and at vnawares, it reſorted to them agayne, and was abſorpt. For euen as a ſtone naturally ſeeketh to the midle of the earthly globe, ſo he as if by a certayne naturall inſtinct he had reſted only in God, being violently rent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, was thither agayne ſnatched, as it were to his proper center. Therfore vpon a tyme being perplexed in mynd, that he could not be obedient to the will of his ſuperiours, he ſaid, to a certaine Prieſt, that he was ſomwhat familiar withall: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily I do not know, what I should do: Father Rectour forbiddeth me to attend to prayer, least by ouermuch buſying my mind I should hurt my head; but I am more grieuouſly wearied and vexed, with recalling my mind from thinking of God, then if I should endeauour dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thinke vpon him. Which truly by vſe is as it were connerted to nature, neither is it now any
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:17839:134"/>
labour vnto me, but rest and ſolace. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I will striue as well as I may, to accomplish that which he commaundeth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So ſoone as he ſaw that all kind of prayer was forbidden him, in exchange therof, he would often aſcend into the Quire of the Church to adore the Bleſſ. Euchariſt. There ſo ſoone as he had but fallen vpon his knees he would ſtraight way riſe, and leaſt by ſome cogitation he might be abſtracted from his ſenſes, or reflect aduiſedly vpon God, he would ſpeedily conuey himſelf from thence. But this diligence little auailed him. For how much the more out of his loue of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience he laboured to fly, ſo much the more earneſtly did God purſue him, and intereſt him in him, &amp; cheriſh his hart with all cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall illuminations and delicacies. Which he perceauing, leaſt he ſhould violate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds of his Superiour, would actually refuſe, and with a ſubmiſſe mind ſpeaking vnto God, would ſay: <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Likewiſe it was no ſmall buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for him, to turne his corporall ſenſes to the performing of their offices. For ſo ſoone as his mind was once rapt with God, he neither had vſe of eyes, nor eares.</p>
               <p>In this ſanctimony and height of vertue, he conuerſed euen till the end of October of the yeare 1586. in the houſe of the Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> to the great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Superiours, that directed his
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17839:134"/>
mind, and to the greate fruite and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his equals; who to the intent that they might better themſelues daily by his communication and example, did with great complacency thirſt after his company.</p>

               <p>AT what time B. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> made his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhip at <hi>Rome</hi> in the houſe of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices at <hi>Saint Andrewes,</hi> in Monte-Cauallo, there gouerned that Houſe, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Nouices, <hi>F.

This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely-happy man was in the mortifying of his body with daily abſtinences, frequent faſts, ſharpe hairecloth, and diſciplines, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with continuall watchings very rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Which although he did endeauour to do as priuately as he might, notwithſtading it could not all togeather paſſe concealed from ſo many his Children, who had their eyes ſtedfaſtly fixed vpon him, with a deſire both to obſerue and imitate him. Whilſt he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:17839:135"/>
ſate, ſtood, or went, in ſuch ſort did he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate his apparrell, countenance, and his whole exteriour habit, that he appeared a notable ſpectacle of modeſty. His counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was alwayes cheerfully ſerene: his mouth was compoſed to a moderate &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſinyle, which was able to mollify what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer behoulders troubled mind. He was neuer ſeene to alter his colour vpon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident were it ioyfull or ſiniſter, neuer to lay a ſide the tranquility of his aſpect, neuer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deiected with griefe, or to much elate with vaine mirth. He alwayes kept one and the ſelfe ſame tenour, as an index of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued affections, &amp; of that inward peaceable calmeneſſe, which he perpetually enioyed; wherupon he neuer diſcouered ſo much as the leaſt ſigne of an impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or angry mind. He thought himſelfe more deſpicable then all the world beſides, he had a very humble conceit of himſelfe, whatſoeuer he did he reputed himſelfe vile.</p>
               <p>It is an incredible thing to declare what an inflamed affection he had to prayer. And how much by the benefit of God, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled therin, this may ſerue for a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that ſometymes in the night, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tooke their reſt, he was found in the place of exhortation ſeriouſly praying, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by diuine power eleuated the height of ſome handfull from the ground, he hung in the ayre. This did that Father who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in that office teſtify vnto me, &amp;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17839:135"/>
it was committed to print in the letters of the Society of the yeare 1591. in which, where there is diſcourſe of the Colledge at <hi>Naples,</hi> there are celebrated many of this mans ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
               <p>He obſerued very carefully the precepts of a Religious life which are ſet downe by <hi>S. Baſil.</hi> He was ſo far in loue with the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Ioannes Caſsianus</hi> the Abbot, that he had them almoſt all without booke. But with all his mind he endeauoured to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in his actions, thoſe precepts which he ſaw giuen by thoſe ancient Fathers remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable for ſanctity.</p>
               <p>It is ſcarce credible, how conſiderate and ſparing he was in his words. Therfore there was neuer any word of his, hurtfull to any one, nor otherwiſe then exemplar vnto all. There was no man of a more ſweet conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; his diſcourſe he ſeaſoned with witty and pleaſant conceits, keeping himſelfe with in a Religious moderation, for which he was meruelouſly beloued of all. Towards the poore that loue by begging, &amp; chiefly thoſe that are reſtrained by ſhamefaſtneſſe, he was ſo mercifull, that to cloath them, he is read to haue taken off his owne garments. Now in the gouernement of thoſe that were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to him, facility tempered ſeuerity: and with admirable art, to grauity he ioyned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability, and the contempt of honour. So he became venerable vnto all, troble ſome to none. He burned with charity towards all.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17839:136"/>
But of the Nouices, ſuch was his care and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, that he may well be reputed to the all a Father, a Mother, &amp; a Nurſe. He would for a litle while diſſemble their faults, til he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formed their minds according to his owne deſire.

For hauing ſufficiently experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that it is a thing prepoſterous to draw all by one way, he pointed out vnto euery one which way he might iourney to perfect vertue, as might beſt ſtand with his health &amp; capacity.</p>
               <p>He would not haue his Nouices be ouer
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17839:136"/>
ſolicitous to caſt themſelues into an affected compoſition, either of countenance, or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which ſhortly after their Nouiſhip they were to put off againe; but he procured, that they ſhould put on that kind of modeſty, which they were willing to maintaine all the courſe of their life in Religion. Likewiſe that they ſhould lay for their foundation, ſolid vertues, and deſpiſing of themſelues. He deſired that Nouices, ſhould reuerence and thinke as truth required, of thoſe that were now their ancients in religion, as being wont to ſay, that there was as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene Nouices, &amp; thoſe that now in Colledges did apply themſelues to good artes, as betweene thoſe that learne their firſt <hi>A.</hi> B. <hi>C.</hi> and thoſe that haue arriued to the learning of <hi>Philoſophy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I haue beene very well acquainted with many of my fellowes, who paſſed their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhip vnder him, whome I found all of them to haue a great opinion of his ſanctity, and their iudgments full-fraught with praiſe of his manner of gouernment. Verily towards euery one he was very charitable, mild, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, and (which is moſt to be eſteemed of) he hadled the matter ſo impartially with them all, that euery one of them thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be only &amp; intirely beloued of him, neyther could ſuſpect that any one was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more eſteemed, or more vehemently affected. Wherfore he was exceedingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued againe, and he was an aſſured refuge to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17839:137"/>
them all in whatſoeuer their neceſsity. He deliuered the courſe of a Religious life to his Nouices rather by his example, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his words, or exhortation. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing did he inioyne others which he did not firſt fulfill himſelfe, neither did he euer commit, that by any one he might be noted, to haue declined from any manner of duty, how little ſoeuer it was.</p>
               <p>Many things ſomewhat miraculous are both ſpoken and written of him. As namely that with his only aſpect he put forth a fire, in the quenching wherof many men had loſt both much labour and water. That he had a Diuine inſtinct, in beholding the factes of his ſubiects that were abſent, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating into the ſecrets of their harts, and their inward cogitations. Of which matter many exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples that fel out at <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>Naples,</hi> are by very graue Fathers recounted at this day.</p>
               <p>It hath bene now reported from the yeare 1582. that the houſe of the Nouices being once very much diſtreſſed for want of dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly victuals, he retired into his chamber, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought Almighty God to eaſe the ſame, and chat there came vnto his doore an Angell in the habit of a young man, and when hauing ſent for the Father he had deliuered into his hands a certaine ſumme of money, which might relieue their preſent penury, that he ſuddenly vaniſhed out of their ſight. For reſpect of theſe things he was of all held
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:17839:137"/>

               <p>Therfore at <hi>Naples,</hi> when being vpon his departure out of this life, he had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his ſacred <hi>viaticum,</hi> he endeauoured to aboliſh out of the minds of thoſe that were preſent, this opinion, who in that his laſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage had an attentiue eye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all his ſayings and doings, whome they reputed to be in the number of the Saints. But how much the more he endeauoured to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his vertue, by ſo much the more did his ſingular modeſty, and contempt of glory, by the ſhewing of ſo remarkable an example, in his very laſt farewell giuen to earth, and entrance into Heauen, diſcouer it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>This Father ſo deere to God, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> with a principall reuerence and loue obſerued, not only becauſe he was his Superiour, for which reſpect he held him as the Vicar of God, but alſo for ſo much, as he ſaw him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with vertues, perfect &amp; accompliſht with all the exact rules of religion, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into his life as into a mirrour, he tooke a patterne therby. Therfore curiouſly did he note all his words and deeds, and deſirous to be corrected and inſtructed by him, he communicated with him all the inward ſtate of his mind. And it was very pleaſing in like manner to this good Father to conuerſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> whoſe mind he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued to be ſingularly pure, moſt fittly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receaue the diſcipline of celeſtiall

things, and repleniſhed with all vertuous &amp; diuine endowments. Which vertues truly &amp; endowments, if he before his death might haue commended to poſterity, we ſhould not haue bene ſo ignorant of many other things concerning <hi>B. Aloyſius.</hi>

When after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the time came, that this Father ſhould depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> it was <hi>Fa.

Amongſt theſe was our <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> for whoſe grieuous head-ake a remedy was ſought. Knowing that he was to go, he began to be trobled in mind, for that he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red leaſt by ſimply affirming, that he would

willingly accompany the Father, might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſome certaine determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for ſaid he, <hi>Oportebat reſpondere in Praeſidum poteſtate futurum, neque vilum eo inclinantis, aut abhorrentis animi ſignum dare.</hi> I ought to haue anſwered, that it ſhold be in the power of my Superiours, and not to haue giuen any ſigne of a mind, either inclining or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant therunto: Although <hi>F. Generall</hi> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not ſo much with his ſpeach, as with reſpect of his health which he ſaw ſo euill diſpoſed. Wherfore it ſeemed good to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius,</hi> not only for euer after that, not to ſhew any propenſion to one part or other, but alſo to procure that others ſhould not affirme him to will, or not will any thing, but with a mind equall to all things to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon his Superiours authority. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe making knowne to many, the ſcruple which came into his mind, he aſſured them that it was very trobleſome vnto him, to do any thing according to his owne will. But ſo ſoone as the iourny was manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, being queſtionleſſe very ioyfull of ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, he ſaid to one of his fellowes: <hi>Sibi hoc iter gratu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> futurum, quodè P.

               <p>They departed from <hi>Rome</hi> the 26. day
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17839:139"/>
of October of the ſame yeare. After they were come ſo far, as that they were looſing the ſight of <hi>Rome, Aloyſius</hi> turning towards that Citty, with ſingular loue &amp; ſenſe of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty recited that <hi>Ant-hymne, Petrus Apoſtolus &amp; Paulus Doctor genti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> &amp;c.</hi> &amp; the prayer of thoſe two Apoſtles, <hi>Deus cuius dextera &amp;c. F. Piſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> for ſo much as he vomited bloud, was according to the aduiſe of <hi>Phiſitians</hi> carried in a litter. And wheras of thoſe three Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces one of them was ordained to accompany him, the other two to ride togeather, <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> as far forth as he might, contriued that he might be that his companion in the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, preferring the fruite of continuall and moſt pleaſing conuerſation with his Maiſter of a religious life, before the complying with them. But the others, for that they iudged this recreation to be requiſite for him, as being ſomewhat more infirme in health, ſuffered him to enter into the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yet he in that commodity, found out a meanes to diſaccomodate himſelfe. For hauing wrapped vp his gowne as round as a ball, and ſitting vpon it, he was carried no leſſe vneaſily in the litter, then if he had bene vpon horſe backe.</p>
               <p>He paſſed all this iourny in reciting, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with this Father, the Canonicall prayers, and in long diſcourſes of Diuine matters. In which he asked many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of him, and endeauoured to ſtore his mind with very many precepts of pious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17839:139"/>
and excellent ſentences which he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from him. And this good Father not ignorant that he caſt his ſeed into a fertile ground, very willingly enlarged himſelf vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and deliuered the myſteries, and vſe of that celeſtiall <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which he had attained vnto, in ſo many yeares whilſt he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed Nouices. In the Innes it was his whole practiſe, to yield to his fellowes all things that were moſt commodious, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible loue and obſeruance towards them and to take vnto himſelfe the worſt of euery thing. Hauing finiſhed this iourney, he aſſured his fellowes, that by conuerſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly, and maintayning long diſcourſes with that Father, and obſeruing all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and manners in conuerſing with ſecular men, he had profited more in thoſe few daies then by liuing many moneths in the houſe of the Nouices.</p>
               <p>They arriued at <hi>Naples</hi> on the Kalends of Nouember. At which tyme, when by the Maiſters of the Colledg, there was renouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made of the ſtudyes of learning, it ſeemed good to the Superiours, that <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> who as we haue ſaid before had learned the one part of his philoſophy, before he gaue ouer the world, ſhould now ſtudy the later part therof which remained: and he with all his hart betooke himſelfe to this that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him. The Father who at that tyme gouerned the colledge, being accuſtomed to handle himſelfe ſharpely and auſterely, ſo
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17839:140"/>
ſoone as he found, that this young ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtood likewiſe ſo affected, tooke great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment truly, and began to giue him leaue, ſomewhat more frequently to execute theſe matters, then as yet at <hi>Rome</hi> he had done, he being very much ioyed, and denouncing himſelfe moſt fortunate in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Naples</hi> there appeared in him ſingular modeſty, prudence, loue of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and obedience of his Superiours, and finally of all ſanctimony. Neyther did any one make any mention of him, but with a diſcouery of the eſtimation of his vertue. Verily his Maiſter in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had notice of his actes lately performed in the Dioceſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> gaue his teſtimony of him in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aloyſius was a man very well knowne vnto me, being one that ſeemed to contemne, &amp; thinke very ſubmiſly of himſelfe: To giue place vnto all, to omit no occaſion were it neuer ſo little, wherby he might tolerate any aſſront from another man. To be incredibly ſeuere towards himſelfe: to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much imployed in offices of piety, in his prayers, and in familiarity with God. Most obſeruant of the rules of Religion: no man more affected to the purity of conſcience. There was added to the praiſe of his pure life a sharpe, and generous wit, but ſuch as was voyd of all inſolent deſire of praiſe. Which thinges, truly, I am ſo much the more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, for ſo much as I did not only know him by the relation of others, but was euen my ſelfe an eye-witneſſe of him whilst he was one of my audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17839:140"/>
at</hi> Naples, <hi>that he gaue an excellent and perpetuall example of theſe good partes. Therfore in regard of his ſingular actions, both I and others of the Colledge of</hi> Naples <hi>intertained a very great opinion of his vertue and ſanctity. But aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> F. Ioannes Baptiſta Piſcator, <hi>a man of approued prudence of mynd, and innocency of life (who after he had dictated to</hi> Aloyſius <hi>the firſt exerciſe of his religious courſe, and aſſisted him in his holy pennance, ended his dayes) reputeth no leſse of him; and in a certaine diſcourſe which he had with me, declared that he obſerued in him an extraordinary kind of ſanctity.</hi> Theſe are the words of the Mayſter. Some others, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t that very tyme liued in the ſame Colledge, do teſtify by other writings, that he at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> did what he could not to be knowne; that he often applyed himſelfe to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of the houſe-hold ſeruants; and that he did his vtmoſt endeauour as much as he might, to diſſembl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and hide the ſplendour of his Deſcent. Therefore when newes was brought, that <hi>Gouzaga</hi> the Patriarch, was made Cardinall, he ſeemed no more to be moued, then if it had nothing concerned him: yet notwithſtanding it is ſufficiently manifeſt, that aboue all his kindred he was beloued of him, for ſo much as he had put to his helping hand in opening him a way to Religion.</p>
               <p>The ſuperiours placed <hi>Aloyſius</hi> in that part of the houſe which was deſigned for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, in a chamber the largeſt, by much, of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17839:141"/>
all the reſt, togeather with man chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that many might reape profit by the excellent example of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; but for ſo much as in the night he was ouerwearyed with watching, it was requiſite that he ſhold recompence that which he loſt in the night with his morning-ſleepe. And yet other his companions, who were to riſe before day, were an impediment that he could not ſo much as then take his reſt. By which, when his Superiours perceaued his health to be impayred, they were willing that he ſhold be placed in a chamber alone by himſelfe, where they thought he might more commodioſly repoſe in quiet. But that likewiſe was vnder a great chamber, throgh which there was a paſſage to diuers lodging chambers, in ſo much as this which <hi>Aloyſius</hi> lay in, did almoſt alwayes reſound with the noyſe, one while of one, an otherwhile of another, that went to and fro, and was much leſſe fit for that which was deſired, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other was before. Hauing diſcouered this thing, he rendred thankes to God, and did in ſuch ſort accept this occaſion of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome aduerſity, that he accounted it as a benefit.</p>
               <p>And ſurely that it ought ſo to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is euen thereby manifeſt, for that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Superiours did with all vigilant care cheriſh him, yet notwithſtanding very many things ſome did obſerue, not without admiration, which truly were not vſuall, but
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17839:141"/>
might worthily be attributed to the diuine prouidence, ſuggeſting matter to his deſire of obedienee, the augmenting of his merit, and the purchaſing for him a more glorious crowne. As when once he went out of doors with his gowne extraordinary ſhort, and not only bare and torne, but alſo ſo old, that it had all changed colour almoſt; ſuch a one as the Superiours themſelues would haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded any one elſe to haue left of for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency ſake: yet in him, they ſeemed neuer ſo much as to take notice of the ſame. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer it often fell out that ſame winter, that he went togeather with his other fellowes to to the houſe of the profeſſed Fathers to ſing Euenſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was raine &amp; ſtormy wether: once when the Miniſter of the colledge ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing euery one in the porch, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding others to their cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to ſtirre one foot out of doores, who were not ſo infirme in their health as he was, of him as it ſeemed he neuer refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, which if he had done, without all queſtion he would haue layd vpon him the ſame commandment.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, although in the Colledge of <hi>Naples</hi> there is vſed ſo much care and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards the ſicke as in no houſe of the Society more; notwithſtanding there was a time when <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> being at once ſick both of an inflammation and a feuer, with which he was troubled a whole moneth, &amp; though he had very diligent ſeruitours, yet he wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted

all one night the ſheetes to his bed, which I verily thinke neuer happened at any tyme to any one of the Society, that hath beene ſicke in the Colledge. But in this man God ſuffered it, to the intent that he might doe a thing acceptable to him. It is very ſtrange how patiently, and with how much ſerenity of countenance he alwayes ſuſtained that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, althogh it was accompanied with moſt grieuous torments, &amp; thoſe continuall, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying himſelfe in his communications with thoſe that came to viſit him with great faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſubmiſſneſſe. So ſoone as he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of that, finding that, that climate did not ſtand well with his health, and that furthermore the paines of his head did daily increaſe, by the will of <hi>Fa. Generall,</hi> when he had conuerſed at <hi>Naples,</hi> by the ſpace of halfe a yeare, he tooke his iourny towards <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſeauenth of May the yeare 1587.</p>

               <p>THE returne of <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> brought exceeding much ioy both to all the young men of the Roman Colledge, and eſpecially vnto thoſe, who wheras they had knowne him in the houſe of the Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

Thoſe things which hereafter I ſhall explane, euen to the bleſſed end of his life, I profeſſe my ſelfe to haue bene a ſpectatour, for the moſt part of them all. For ſo much as at the very ſame time, I togeather with others who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the ſame Colledge, was familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and euen from that time (as I related in my Proeme of this hiſtory) I began ſeriouſly to obſerue him, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that I might commit the ſelfe-ſame things to writing.</p>
               <p>Therfore proceeding at <hi>Rome</hi> in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtudies of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> he diſcouered in a ſhort time how excellently well learned he was both in Logicke &amp; naturall <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> &amp; ſo great a proficient was he in that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of humane wiſedome, that by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of his Moderatours, he was iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged moſt fit to diſpute publikely according to the cuſtome vpon his propounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. Therfore after he had ſet downe in print his opinion concerning all thoſe poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which are wont to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in ſchooles by the Maiſters, about the ſixt moneth after his entrance into the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17839:143"/>
Colledge, he defended the ſame publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely againſt the arguments of all that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him. But for ſo much as it pleaſed the moſt illuſtrious <hi>Gardinalls Roboreo</hi> of <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regale,</hi> and <hi>Gonzaga</hi> to be preſent, and heare him diſpute, it was performed in the greateſt ſchoole, and not in that of the Diuines, as for the moſt part it was wont to be by other men of the Society Applauſe was giuen him by all that were preſent; but chiefly it gaue great contentment to the Cardinalls, who did very much admire, that in ſo ſhort a time being ſo infirme of health he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited ſo much in knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now for ſo much as we haue made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this diſputation, we may adioyne therunto two things. The one, that before he entred into it, he for ſome ſpace debating with himſelfe, whether to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he might depreſſe himſelfe, he ſhould vpon ſet-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe anſwere vnskilfully; when out of his owne opinion he durſt not determine vpon either part, he asked counſell of <hi>F. Mutius de Angelis,</hi> who at that time profeſſed <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> in that Colledge, a man excellent not only in learning, but alſo in vertue and the vſe of celeſtiall matters, with whome he was wont to haue frequent diſcourſe of Diuine things. And wheras be truly prudently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this thing, alleaging reaſons therfore ; notwithſtanding in the middeſt of his diſputation <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was aſſaulted with that deſire of deſpiſing himſelfe. He pauſed a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:17839:143"/>
litle being doubtfull in mind, til the reaſons of the Father tooke place with him, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe that cogitation, he determined as learnedly as he could, to ſolue the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe that oppoſed: neither did he performe otherwiſe, then he determined. The other was, that when as in regard of his loue to Humility, he could not endure to heare his owne prayſes, notwithſtanding there was truly, a Doctour of great note, who being about to oppoſe his concluſions, made I know not what Preamble, of his prayſes, the kindred &amp; progeny that he was deſcended from. He was ſo much abaſhed at this prayſe, that as many as were preſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ignorant how much he abhorred from it, tooke commiſeration vpon him, &amp; before others the Cardinall of <hi>Monte-regale</hi> ſeemed much to be taken therwith, when he obſerued his ingenuous baſhfulneſſe, and modeſt ſhamefaſtneſſe. But he did alwayes after, ſo meet with thoſe things, that this Doctour diſputed of, that he ſeemed to be ſomewhat angry in mind.</p>
               <p>Hauing finiſhed his ſtudies of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> he was next brought to Diuinity, in which he had many Maiſters, both <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> men famous both for learning and wiſedome, who had many yeares diſcharged that office. Theſe did he exceedingly reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour: of them he neuer ſpake otherwiſe then with great reſpect. He neuer diſſented from them in opinion or iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17839:144"/>
He neuer taxed them for their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of teaching or dictating, neuer for their ſhort or long diſcourſe of queſtions, or any other thing of that kind; he neuer ſhewed any forward inclination towards new or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſuall opinions. He built only vpon the writings of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi> whoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was of an excellent and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wit, ioyned with a ſingular grauity of iudgment; the which both we perceaued, &amp; his Maiſters themſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, of which one of them doubted not to affirme, that he neuer was carefull to premeditate, what he ſhould anſwere to them that asked, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted againſt him, when there occurred any intricate queſtion, but only to <hi>Aloyſius Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga.</hi> He accompanied this wit of his, with induſtrious ſtudy, as much as might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him, either in reſpect of his health, the weakeneſſe of his forces, or the will of his Superiours. He neuer ſet to his ſtudy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vpon his knees he had made ſome ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Almighty God. He beſtowed not his ſtudy, in turning ouer, and conſidering the bookes of diuers authours, nor in any one Commentary elſe, but thoſe only that were his Maiſters. If there came into his mind any reaſon contrary to that which was taught him, which of himſelfe he was
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17839:144"/>
not able to refute, hauing noted the ſame, he did afterward at the breaking-vp of the ſchooles, when all others had propounded their queſtions, aske his Maiſters opinion concerning his difficulties. But ſometimes when he had gathered many thinges, which ſeemed to haue ſome doubt in them, he tooke ſome time which he hoped might be leaſt troubleſome to his Maiſters, and went to their ſtudies to require their anſwers. Whilſt he asked their Counſell, he vſed no other language but <hi>Latin,</hi> neither would he ſtand otherwiſe then with his hat in his hand, till by commaund they made him put it on. So ſoone as his Maiſter had ſouled his doubts, ſtraight-way he betooke him to his ſtudy in his chamber. He neuer medled with any booke but by the permiſſion and perſuaſion of his Maiſters. In which thing how much he ſtood vpon their word, you may euen perceaue by this that followeth. <hi>F. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Iustinian</hi> his Maiſter, when he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated vnto him in his ſtudy a certaine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty about predeſtination which he asked him, hauing explaned vnto him the ſeauenth <hi>Tome</hi> of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and pointing-out with his finger, euen almoſt to the end of his booke <hi>De bono perſenerantiae,</hi> he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to reade, what that holy man had written there of the ſame argument. He read-through all that page which was poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out vnto him, neither would he ſo much as turne-ouer the leafe to read thoſe ten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17839:145"/>
lines which vpon the other ſide ended the booke; queſtionleſſe, for ſo much as he was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to go any further. And yet thoſe lines which were on the other ſide, <hi>Iustinianus</hi> himſelfe had not obſerued.</p>
               <p>Both at home, and in the ſchoole, as often as by the Bedell he was warned to thoſe kind of exerciſes, he either argued againſt, or anſwered others: and for the ſame, if any of the reſt ſhould be leſſe accommodated, he profeſſed, that to ſupply their place, he wold be at his diſpoſall.</p>
               <p>He diſputed ſharpely, but modeſtly: he would neuer in his ſpeach exaſperate any one, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſtomake them, nor raiſe any cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, nor interrupt him that anſwered, but giue him ſpace to declare what his mind, &amp; opinion was. The doubt &amp; obſcurity of the queſtio being take away, he did ingenuouſly aſſent, and make an end of the controuerſy.</p>
               <p>Before the bell did ring to Schooles, &amp; in like manner before he returned home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, both before and after noone, he daily frequented the ſacred Church, to adore the moſt holy Euchariſt. In his going and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the ſchooles, he was of ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and compoſed a behauiour, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the loue of piety, euen ſtrangers who being ſtudious of learning, ſtood to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould him in the Court next to the ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. And eſpecially a certaine Abbot that was a ſtranger, hauing in that <hi>Academy</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his courſe of Diuinity, being allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17839:145"/>
with the loue of his Modeſty, frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſchoole for no other cauſe then to behould him; neyther did he euer in the Schooles take his eyes of him. And this ought not much to be admired at: for the Prouinciall of the Society, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Venetians, did affirme there, before the Tribunall of the Patriarch, that that ſaying ſeemed fitly to agree to B <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> which <hi>S.

Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſuch like effects as theſe, did the aſpect of this happy you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> produce in the minds of his behoulders. Therfore to him alſo ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe words that follow, <hi>Iusti ſanat aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectus, &amp; ipſi oculorum radij virtutem quandam videntur infundere ijs:</hi> The aſpect of a iuſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, healeth, and the very beames of his eyes do ſeeme to infuſe a certayne vertue into them who faythfully deſire to behould him. All which, this our <hi>Aloyſius</hi> made good in his very cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, &amp; moſt dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t habit of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, being very apt to moue the minds of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a ſenſe of piety &amp; holſome griefe. Add herunto, that the only behoulding of him,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:17839:146"/>
did not only admoniſh ſtrangers and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious young men his companions, but euen moſt graue prieſts of their duty. Therfore in his preſence they ſeemed to take vnto them a certayne grauity. Neyther would they in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, raſhly vtter any licencious word, or do any action tending to leuity. Whilſt he went to the ſchoole, or from thence went home, whilſt he remained there, or was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at diſputations, he was neuer diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vtter ſo much as one word to any one, were he domeſticall or ſtranger. So ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruant was he of the rule of ſilence.</p>
               <p>When his Superiours ſaw him vexed with perpetuall ſickneſſe, and weakeneſſe of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they forbad him to write his dictates in the ſchoole, but to that end to make vſe of a Scribe. Neither truly could he, who as yet had attained no dexterity therin, keepe touch, with the ſwiftneſſe of his wrighting to the voyce of the Maiſters that dictated. He truly obayed, but ſuppoſing, that it wold be an vnſeemely thing, that mony ſhould be in the hands of them, that for infirmity ſake ſhould imploy another to write for them, or that they ſhould vndergoe any care in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his wages for his paines, for ſo much as he ſaid there was da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger therin, that might expoſe him to violate the integrity of his pouerty, he auoyding that buſineſſe, ſent his writer to call for his hire of the Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the Colledge, whoſe office it was to diſcharge ſuch payments. His writings he
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17839:146"/>
willingly lent to any one that requeſted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and asked not for them againe, before they of their owne accord reſtored them.</p>
               <p>There was a time when <hi>Fa. Gabriel <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſquez</hi> his Maiſter being ſcanted of time, was not able to finiſh in the whole reuolution of the yeare, his diſputations of the Trinity. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deliuering only thoſe which ſeemed to be moſt neceſſary, he left the reſt to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out by his ſchollers. The Superiours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund <hi>Aloyſius</hi> that he take order, that his Scribe performe that. He, when he had read ouer his Maiſters Commentary, omitting thoſe things which were more eaſy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be choſen out thoſe, which were moſt hard and ſeemed to be moſt vſefull. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked why he did ſo? he ſaid: <hi>Qui a pauper ſum, paupertatis studio id ſacio: neque enim de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet pauperem, niſi in res neceſsarias ſumptum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> For ſo much as I am a poore man, out of my loue to pouerty I do it: for it befitteth not a poore man, to lay out any coſt, but v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon neceſſary things. Notwithſtanding in the laſt yeare of his ſtudies, fearing leaſt any one ſhould interprete this his continuance from writing his dictats in the Schooles, either to be out of ſome deſire of vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſuperfluous relaxatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he dealeth with his Superiours, that by their good leaue he might write with his owne hand. Neither were reaſons wanting, wherwith he eaſily perſuaſed them to that which he required. But wheras he, could not equall with the,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:17839:147"/>
ſwifeneſſe of his hand, his Maiſters tongue, he attended for a certaine ſpace thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which were ſaid, and afterward ſet them downe abridged. And after the ſchooles, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Schoole-fellowes writings, from thence he added whatſoeuer neceſſary thing he had omitted. Which labor yielded much contentment vnto him, in regard of the loue which he had of informing others, &amp; exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with his example. He would ſuffer no booke to remaine in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, but what he had frequent vſe of, ſaying; that it was not the part of a Religious man who pretended pouerty, to detaine any booke with him which he but ſeldome looked vpon, when truly with very little trouble to himſelfe he might go to reap the ſame at the common li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary. And at laſt he came to that, that beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the ſacred Bible, &amp; the Summe of <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> he would keepe no other bookes with him. If he had need to looke in any place, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ither in the holy Fathers or any other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he betooke him to the common library. He found afterward that one of his fellowes who had lately come to the Colledge wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Summe of <hi>S. Thomas.</hi> For wheras in that Colledge beſides the Fathers and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, there were more then forty in number, who ſtudied Diuinity, there could neither in common ſo many bookes of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> be accommodated to them, neither is there leaue giuen for euery one to procure them, or keep them priuately for himſelfe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17839:147"/>
                  <hi>Aloyſius</hi> goeth vnto the Rectour: &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreateth him, that it would pleaſe him to giue him leaue, to lend to that his fellow the Summe which was giuen him to vſe; for ſo much as he might make vſe of another that a certaine chaberfellow of his had, he did leſſe ſtand need of this. And his ſpeach was ſo perſuaſiue to the Rectour that he yielded. This was a very ioyfull thing to him, either for that this charitable office to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his fellow was very pleaſing vnto him, or for ſo much, as he now perceaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be become more needy, when he had none of his owne, and of common bookes only the vſe of the Bible.</p>
               <p>So much came into my mind to rehearſe of the ſtudies of <hi>B. Aloyſius.</hi> Now there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth vnto me to ſpeake far more of his Chriſtian vertues, with which at this time he floriſhed. Which perfection of vertues truly, both that which was apparent &amp; prompt in his conuerſation, and alſo that which was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in his mind, he was ſo wholy poſſeſſed of, that more then 200.

               <p>He had a very humble conceit of himſelfe; and that, that was in the inward ſenſe of his mind, he declared both in his words, and actions. He neuer at any time did, or ſaid any thing which might much tend to his owne prayſe. Yea rather with admirable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence concealed all that his ſecular ſplendor, kindred, family, titles of the Marqueſate, &amp; others of the ſame kind. In like manner thoſe which were more peculiarly his, as ſtrength of wit, accompliſhment of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and other things which might apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto his prayſe. Therfore euen at the very ſuſpition of his owne prayſe, he bluſhed like a tender Virgin: and whoſoeuer had but a deſire to ſee him bluſh, might by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſooner put him to it, then by prayſing him. Of this matter I will only alleage two examples, omitting many others. The one was, when as a certaine <hi>Phiſitian,</hi> who came to viſit a ſicke man, began to celebrate his prayſes, in reſpect of the Nobility of the bloud of the <hi>Gonzaga's,</hi> his neere alliance li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:17839:152"/>
to the Dukes of <hi>Mantua,</hi> &amp; his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred reſulting from that Family he came of. For truly, wheras he deſired to haue his fortune obſcured from the ſight of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much offended with this prayſe, he gaue a remonſtrance to the <hi>Phiſitian,</hi> how much it trobled him. And for ſo much as he tooke many occaſions to prayſe him in that manner, he was very much out of conceit with the honour of his Anceſtours: &amp; when there was any one that did but rub-vp the memory of theſe things in his mind, or ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make any account of him for any endowment either of Nature, or Fortune, that queſtionleſſe did ſo exulcerate his mind, that nothing could do more. Therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this one only griefe which he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for prayſe, or honour attributed vnto him for ſuch like cauſes as theſe, he ſeemed to haue weeded out of his mind by the very root, all other affections.</p>
               <p>At another time, when in the Refectory, he had ſpoken out of the pulpit, very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and fittly accommodated to piety, concerning the Purification of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and deſerued praiſe was giuen him by all his auditours; ſo ſoone as <hi>F. Hieronymus Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> began to his face to commend that his ſpeach, he was ſo much abaſhed, and ſeemed ſo much to be troubled with thoſe prayſes, &amp; to eſchew them as not belonging to him, (being ſo perſuaded out of his ſingular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty) that it gaue great contentment to all
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17839:152"/>
their minds. For by this his modeſt baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he became very gratefull and amiable vnto all.</p>
               <p>At home and abroad he would giue place to all. If at any time he were ſent forth with any of his fellowes who had the charge of domeſticall matters (amongſt whome ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Cooke of the Roman Colledge was one) he would offer place vnto them; if they denied it, he would alleage ſo many cauſes of this his requeſt, that they, leaſt they ſhold contriſtate his mind, could not but obey him. But for this reſpect truly, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by his Superiours, who forbad him to do it any more, if it were for no other reward, but euen for that, leaſt he ſhould ſeeme too little to reuerence the name of a Clergy-man, and the dignity of Tonſure, to which he ſhould rather be obſeruing then to too much d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iection of himſelfe. At home he often laid his hands to the helping of dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall buſineſſes, put himſelfe into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of other ſimple men, and this very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. In like manner when the bellrung to meales, for the moſt part he ſate him downe at ſome table, which in the outmoſt corner of the Refectory, was frequented by the Cookes, and other ſeruants, as being neare their offices. He had commaund from his Superiours, who perceaued him weake and afflicted in his health, that he ſhould ſit at their table who were but lately recouered out of ſickneſſe, that he ſhould not riſe from
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:17839:153"/>
thence togeather with the reſt, and that he ſhould in like manner abſtaine from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther labours. He fearing leaſt this might ſeeme to be attributed vnto him in regard of his family, often went to his Superiours, and producing good reaſons gaue them to vnderſtad, that there was no cauſe why they ſhould account him as ſingular in any thing, and at laſt obtained that he might togeather with the reſt, follow the common courſe of liuing. And ſome of his familiar friendes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him, that he would obey this the will of his Superiours, for ſo much as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it was to be feared, leaſt he might fall into ſome diſeaſe he anſwered, that he being a Religious man, ſhould endeauour all that he could, to inſiſt in the ſame courſe of life, which others did that were ioyned with him in the ſame Religion; and whilſt he did not go againſt his obedience, he ſtood in feare of no diſeaſe truly, that ſhould be taken by vndergoing thoſe thinges which are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to the inſtitute of his Religion. There are reſident for the moſt part in the Roman Colledge ſome 200. men, or rather more, ſo as it cannot be, that euery one of the Society that ſtudieth there, ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with a ſeuerall chamber. Wherfore the Superiours, affoarding only particuler lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, to the Prieſtes, the Maiſters of the Colledge, and ſome others, who are either ſomewhat infirme, or performe ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar office, the reſt being diſtributed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to their pleaſure, into ſeuerall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they place in diuers chambers, which are furniſhed with many beds, and deskes to ſtudy at. Therfore, wheras they thought good that <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> in regard that he was ſomewhat ſickly, ſhould lodge by himſelfe ſequeſtred from the reſt, he goeth to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour and perſuadeth him, that it would be an example of better edification to others, if he might vſe his chamber in common, with ſome chamber-fellowes. And for ſo much as he reputed it a kind of magnificence, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate any one that was a ſtudent in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, inſteed of them he ſuffered ſome man of a more inferiour ranke to be ranged with him. He had requeſted that there ſhould be committed vnto him the Prefectſhip ouer ſome company in the Semi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nary, for ſo much as beſides the abiection which they willin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly ſuffer for Gods loue, the Prefects are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted therin with great incommodities, &amp; ſubiect themſelues to a grieuous, and in a manner a continuall ſeruitude. But for ſo much as his Superiours miſtruſted, that his health would not be able to ſuſtaine ſo great a burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they durſt not then giue way to it.</p>
               <p>He deſired moreouer, that hauing ended his ſtudy of Diuinity, he might haue leaue to inſtruct the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer-boyes of the loweſt ſorme, both for that he deſired to open a way for himſelfe to informe that their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age with the preceps of vertue and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian piety, of which office of the Grammer-Maiſters,

he had a holy emulation, and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king familiarly vnto them, he was wont to call them Bleſſed: and alſo, for that he had great delight to deſcend to thoſe thinges, wherby he might abaſe himſelfe, &amp; haue no prerogatiue before others. He often tooke vpon him this taske, and that he might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his requeſting therof, for the loue of vertue and humility, he bore Father Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour in hand, that he was ignorant in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and not ſufficiently poliſhed in the Latin tongue: That he was altogether vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (vnleſſe he learned theſe things) to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the deſignes of the Society.</p>

he ſhould neuer come to be exactly skilfull in the Latin tongue and in Grammer: &amp; that it now remained expedient for him to learne it by teaching others. Many times in ſome old cloake carying a basket, or a wallet, he would with great contentment beg for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes through the Citty: and at home there was no office ſo vile and abiect, which he was not more feruently in loue withall, then ambitious men are with honours or digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Euery munday and tweſday it was his cuſtome euery weeke to ſerue in the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin. And he made it his chiefeſt worke to wipe the diſhes when they were brought from the table, and to gather the ſcraps of meat, to relieue the neceſſity of the poore. And when he might haue leaue (which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten had, by importuning his Superiours to that end) he carried in a basket that ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame reliefe, out of pious charity appointed for the poore, to them wayting at the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge gate. Verily, he would euery day in like manner when he came from the ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, do ſome other contemptible worke, as to ſweepe his chamber, or other places that were appointed for him, to take away ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-webs with a reed, or ſome longpole in the Halles, or commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> parlors. Moreouer for many yeares it was his worke to cleanſe the lamps in the galleries and publike ſchools of the Colledge, and to repaire them by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wring in oyle and putting-in wickes when need required: which ſeruices did ſo much

delight him, that when he openly diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ioy, which he was not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale in his mind, they that ſaw him reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed there withall, congratulated this his triumphant, &amp; ſoule-rauiſhing contentment; which ioy he did now profeſſe to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as it were naturall vnto him, &amp; that of it owne accord it did inſinuate it ſelfe into him, conſtrayned by no induſtry or preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.

Moreouer that ſuch a one, ſo ſoone
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:17839:157"/>
as he ſhould change his Superiour for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſhould be leſſe furniſhed, either from nature or good artes, or leſſe affected to him, and ſhould receaue from him any commaund contrary to his humour, muſt of neceſſity be vehemently tormented and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſed to many dangers. To ſubiect a mans ſelfe to another out of ſome humane, &amp; not a celeſtiall reſpect, as we haue ſaid before, he accounted to be the property of a baſe, and abiect mind.</p>
               <p>He feared, leaſt that certaine Superiours might very much hurt, thoſe that they beare rule ouer, who to the intent that they may accommodate themſelues to the infirmity and want of vertue or their ſubiectes, in their gouerning and commaunding, ſerue their turnes of cauſes, with which they exhort them to that which they intend, out of theſe mortall things only. Wherfore his deſire was, that the Superiours of the Society, ſhould confidently diſpoſe of him &amp; others; and that either in the changing of their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or lodgings, and in other matters which were to be determined by them, that they ſhould not alleage any cauſe of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects will, but the honour of God, and the amplifying of his glory, and for that reſpect to ordaine all things.

But if theſe other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; pretextes be ſought after, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects inure themſelues with following an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhadow of Obedience, not the ſolid and expreſſe image therof; they are depriued of thoſe goods that we ſpake of; there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſometimes giuen of vilefiyng their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, eſpecially if there be any facility for them to vnderſtand or ſuſpect, that there is ſome other cauſe, why they are remoued out of their office or place, then that which either in word, or writing is pretended.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he was wont to affirme, that his office of Obedience was ſo much the more gratefull vnto him, for ſo much as he had found by experience, that by the iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his Superiours, there was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a certaine meruelous prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God ouer him. For ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times thoſe thinges were
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17839:158"/>
freely granted &amp; impoſed by his Superiours before he asked, with the deſire wherof he was formerly poſſeſſed, either out of his priuate piety, or by the inſtinct of God. So once it fellout, that whereas he had medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, vpon thoſe places vnto which Chriſt our Lord in his laſt punniſhment was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about, and therupon was ſurpriſed with a great deſire, to goe that day to the ſeauen holy Churches to offer vp his humble pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers according to the cuſtome, his Superiour contrary to his former vſe, before he either asked or hoped for any ſuch thing, ſendes for him that very Loure, and commaundes him to goe viſit the ſeauen holy Churches. That brought vnto him a double ioy, both for that the ſame thing was in it ſelfe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and alſo for that he diſcouered, how great a caſe Almighty God tooke of him, euen in thoſe ſmall matters. I might rehearſe very many of theſe like examples, but that it would be too long.</p>
               <p>If being reprehended by him in whoſe power he was, he did ſo conforme his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and habit, that with his head bare, with his eyes faſtned demiſſely vpon the ground, making no excuſe, or reply, he entertained humbly, and patiently what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſaid. Being vpon a time reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Superiour, for I know not what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The next allied to this his vertue of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, was that his obſeruance of the Rules, vnto which by the diſcipline of Religion he was tyed: in the obſeruing wherof <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was ſo carefully-diligent, that he might ſeeme to goe beyond all others. For neither could he remember, that euer he had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed any one of thoſe rules were it neuer ſo litle, though it were but euen in thought. And now ſo carefully and punctually did he obey them, as if by the neglect of them, he might be brought into ſome great danger, &amp; ſuffer ſome grieuous derriment. In which thing he tooke ſo great liberty to himſelfe, that he ſtood in feare of no perſon, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious or Secular.</p>
               <p>He went on a tyme, as ſent by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, to ſalute <hi>Cardinall Roboreo</hi> his kinſman, who deſiring him to ſtay dinner with him, he ſaid that he could not, for ſo much as it was againſt a certaine rule with which he was obliged.

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. Of his Pouerty, Chastity, Speach, and Conuerſation.</head>
               <p>NOw to Religious Pouerty he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibly affected. In this he did more delight and ſolace himſelfe, then wealthy men do in the aboundance of their riches. For if in the liberty of his former fortune he was ſo far in loue with it, that as we haue ſaid before, euen then he pleaſed himſelfe with homely attire; euery one may eaſily coniecture how he behaued himſelfe in the Society, which he was accuſtomed to intitle the moſt proper houſe of pouerty. Therfore he alwayes abhorred that, wherby he might ſeeme to haue the leaſt ſhaddow of a man, challenging priuately any thing, as it were proper to himſelfe. He was neuer cloathed or apparelled with any thing but out of the common ſtocke: he neuer made vſe of any booke, which he did thinke lawfull to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with him, neither of watch, nor penknife, nor any other caſe of tooles. And of thoſe things which belong to piety, he neyther kept any to beſtow vpon others, neyther was he very much pleaſed when others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed them vpon him. He neuer ſuffered to be in his poſſeſſion any Reliquary, or payre of beades of any pretious, or curious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor ſo much as a priuate picture, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17839:160"/>
But verily ſome one of the common pictures, which he found in the chamber, he made vſe of, or truly he had at the moſt but one priuate to himſelfe of paper, which was of <hi>S. Catherine</hi> the Virgin and Martyr (to wit, vpon whoſe birth-day he en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And theſe, vpon the approbation of his Superiours, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out by others importunities, and as it were by compulſion, he accepted as gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts. What ſhall I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that not ſo much as in his Breuiary truly which in the Nouiſhip, nor in his little booke of the office of the B. Virgin Mother, which he made vſe of in the Colledge, he neuer tolerated ſo much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little picture, for a note, (as many vſe) to diſtinguiſh his prayers.</p>
               <p>And for ſo much as there were not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome, who according to their good wil towards him, not only offered diuers guifts made for the honour of God, but euen of their owne accord hauing requeſted licence of his Superior that he might receaue them, did in a manner thruſt them violently vpon him, if truly he might, he refuſed them: but if without diſpleaſing of them he could do no other then admit them, he ſtraight-way carryed them to his Superiour, or at leaſt hauing gotten leaue from him, ſo ſoone as the next occaſion might ſerue, he beſtowed them vpon others. It was his chiefeſt ioy
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17839:160"/>
to poſſeſſe nothing of this world, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing, and to be ſequeſtred from eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mortall thing.</p>
               <p>When in the beginning of Sommer or winter, there were giuen vnto them hats, &amp; other garmentes, he neuer complayned of any thing for being too long, or too ſhort, too big, or too little: but being asked by the tailour whether they were fit-inough for him, he ſaid: <hi>Mihi quidem videtur:</hi> truly they ſeeme ſo vnto me. He was infinitely pleaſed with euery thing that was moſt poore, and in all thinges that fell vnto his choyſe he caſt his eye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worſt. And he was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner that of our Rule, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is decreed and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that euery one (to the intent that he may the more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome himſelfe, and may learne the more to profit in vertue) ſhould be <hi>perſuaded,</hi> that of thoſe things which are in the houſe, the worſt ſhall alwayes be giuen vnto him. <hi>Euen</hi> as (ſayth he) <hi>a beggar, who from doore to doore, beggeth almes from other men, knoweth very well, that not the best garments, which are in any mans houſe, but the most torne and ould; and in like manner of other thinges, that which is of the least valew, shall be giuen to him: according to the ſame example must we perſuade our ſelues, that if we be truly in loue with pouerty, thoſe thinges in our houſe which are most contemptible, ought to be giuen vnto vs. And he ſaid that ſuch was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of this word</hi> (perſuadeat) <hi>that the meaning therof was, that we should certainely ſet downe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17839:161"/>
in our mindes that it should ſo come to paſse, and that it was most expedient ſo to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, he did often declare to the Father who was wont to take his confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that he eſteemed is in the number of one of his beneficiall merits, that ſuch often had bene the will of God, that in the partition of the things, which were giuen to euery one to vſe, there happenned vnto him the worſt of all others. This in reſpect of his fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t loue to pouerty, he eſteemed as a ſpeciall fauour from Almighty God. For with ſuch modeſt ſhame faſtneſſe did he behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Religion, as though he did from his very hart thinke, that out of commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Superiours, he had bene taken vp into the houſe, as it were out of ragges &amp; ſordid beggary. Therfore whatſoeuer was beſtowed vpon him, he iudged to proceed out of their ſingular charity.</p>
               <p>At the table truly, he ſpared to eate of that meat which he thought would be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his health; notwithſtanding leaſt that ſome better ſhould be brought inſteed of it (which he nothing deſired) he indeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon ſet purpoſe, to deceaue the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>
               <p>I need not rehearſe any thing elſe of his chaſtity, but that he alwayes kept vnſpotted that ineſtimable treaſure of his Virginity, both of body and mind, in ſo excellent and ſingular a luſtre, which I declared in the ſixt chapter of my firſt booke.</p>

In his ſpeach and conuerſation, no man was a greater louer of truth and ſincerity, no man could euer poſſibly diſcouer more candour, or ingenuity. Therfore there were none who could make any the leaſt doubt of that which he either affirmed, or denied. For he was far eſtranged from all deceitfull duplicity or diſſimulation. He was wont al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to affirme, that by trickes, deceites, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations, fallacies, ambiguity either of words or deedes, the men giuen to the Fortune of this world, were bereaued of the mutuall ſociety that ought to be amongſt them; but that in Religion it was the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary poyſon of Religious ſimplicity, the certaine plague of youth, with which ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely could euer agree the ſpirit, that a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man ought to be endowed with.</p>

               <p>AS concerning that taming of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and bridling of his appetites which we call Mortification, he was ſo deſirous of euill treating the ſame, and ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be tranſported ſo much further with that deſire, then his ſtrength might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with all, that had not his Gouernours reſtrained him, he might ſeeme in ſhort time to hazard the cutting-of ſome yeares from

Therfore vnto ſome that ſaid they wondred that he made no conſcience, of ſo often wearying his Superiours about this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of himſelfe, he anſwered, that he, when vpon the one ſide he regarded the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility of his forces, and vpon the other ſide perceaued his mind to be excited to giue forth theſe examples of piety, thought it the beſt courſe that he could take, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the whole matter to his Superiour, who was not a man partially intereſſed in either of thoſe two conſiderations. And that ſo it would come to paſſe, that he only wold giue way to that which ſhould be moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, and nothing elſe. He added that ſometymes he intreated leaue to do thoſe things, which he aſſuredly knew would not be graunted to him. For when he ſaw he might not apply himſelfe vnto them, as he very much deſired, to dedicate this his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to God, and to manifeſt it to him that gouerned him as his Vicegerent, ſeemed for many reſpectes to be auayleable vnto him. Amongſt which, that he numbred as one, that by the iudgement of others he learned to be leſſe ouerweening of himſelfe, for ſo much as reuoluing ſuch things in his mynd he might ſeeme vnto them, in this reſpect truly, not ſufficiently to know himſelfe. And verily ſometimes it pleaſed God, that beyond the opinion of all men, he obtayned leaue for certaine things.</p>
               <p>A certaine man attempted very ſeriouſly
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:17839:162"/>
to queſtion with him, why, for ſo much at he was ſo prudent in other matters, he ſet ſo light by the counſell of Fathers of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued piety and authority, who ſo often had exhorted him, that at laſt he ſhould leaue of, that ſo great ſeuerity towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and earneſtneſſe of mind in meditating vpon diuine matters? Vnto whome <hi>Aloyſius</hi> anſwered in a manner in theſe very wordes: <hi>I perceaue theſe counſells, which you ſpeake of, to be giuen me by two ſorts of men. Of which, one ſort is of them, who lead their life in all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of ſanctity, ſo perfect, that nothing therin occurreth to my view, but it is both be auti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and worthy to be imitated. And truly often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I haue been minded to obey theſe mens ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes: but after I obſerued, that what they adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me, they themſelues would not practiſe, I thought my ſelf rather bound to follow their deeds then their counſells, which proceed only from their charity &amp; indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce towards me. And ſome others there we who what they exhort me to, the ſame they make good in their owne courſes as who are not much addicted to any practiſe of pennaut.

               <p>Moreouer he yielded another reaſon heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For he ſayd, that he very much feared. leaſt that if he ſhold intermit the vſe of theſe afflictions, his nature could not long be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For that this was the cuſtome of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all, whoſe ſanctity became admirable to antiquity, and in particuler of the firſt Fathers of our Religion, and before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our <hi>B. Father Ignatius.</hi> And that he truly, both himſelfe, as we read in his life, ſpent much time in the offices of pennance, and corporall vexation; and that moreouer he left written in his Conſtitutions, that he ſet downe no methodicall courſe to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, and others that were placed in any ſtable degree of the Society, either of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils, Faſts, Diſciplinings, Prayers, and other puniſhments, for ſo much as he confidently preſumed, that they had made ſo great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in excellent ſanctimony, &amp; had ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g with great comfort been inured with theſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17839:163"/>
holſome affections, whilſt they well knew them not to be hurtfull to the pious fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the mind, that they would rather ſtand in need of a bridle, then of a ſpur.</p>
               <p>Moreouer <hi>Aloyſius</hi> added, that the moſt fit time to exact theſe puniſhments of his body was, whilſt he was a man of entire cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall vigour, and in the flouriſhing ſeaſon of his youth. For in regard that his ould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was likely to be infeſted with diſeaſes, would afford leſſe ſtrength for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thoſe things. And that for that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect men of principall ſanctity in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and decrepit age, looke how much they had profited, in the pious imployments of their mind, ſo much for the moſt part they deducted from their corporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but that they neuer altogether left them of. If his Superiour for bad him any of his bodily chaſtiſements, the loſſe that he ſuſtained of that fruit, he recompenſed with ſome other office of piety, as by reading a chapter out of the little booke of the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt, by going to the Church to worſhip the Diuine Euchariſt, or with ſome other ſuch like. Whether he ſtood, or ſare, or walked, he omitted no time wherin he might vexe his body with ſome moleſtation. And wheras his Superiours when they ſaw him ſomewhat debilitated, forebad him the vſe of all haire-cloth, diſciplines, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary faſting, he inuented ſome meanes to exerciſe himſelfe, which might neyther be

repugnant to the will of his Superiours, nor oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Of which ſort this was one, when for his accuſtomed exerciſe of ſpeaking out of the pulpit, he requeſted that he might ſpeake in <hi>Spanish,</hi> ſuppoſing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that for that reſpect all would laugh at him And he obtained leaue to do it.</p>
               <p>To conclude you may haue a ſufficient ſcantling euen by this one thing, how much he thirſted after his owne vexation, for that wheras he had ſo often executed ſo many punniſhmentes vpon himſelfe, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any reſpect to his health, very many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced vnto him that they ſtood in great feare, leaſt when he ſhold come to the houre of death, this ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Vnto which doubt, in his laſt ſickneſſe, he gaue anſwere as after I will recount.</p>
               <p>For the repreſſing of the perturbations of his mind, verily he needed no great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as which he had long ſince ſo ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to himſelfe that he ſeemed altogeather to be deſtitute of them. He beſtowed his greateſt induſtry, in driuing away the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his mind, and if he found himſelfe any thing faulty in that kind, he did not with ouermuch deiection contriſtate his mind, but throwing himſelfe at the feet of God, and determining to expiate himſelfe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:17839:164"/>
by confeſſion, he implored peace with him. Hauing done that, he reſted with a ſecure mind. And this he had learned of that Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Nouices, whom we haue ſpoken of. For he was wont commonly to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell all, that it was a fit remedy, againſt ſuch ſinnes which in our common courſe of life do ſteale vpon vs, and which was both acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to God, and a confuſion to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, to profeſſe our baſeneſſe before God, lifting vp for ſome little time our mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heauen, with theſe or ſuch like words. <hi>En, mi Domine, quam fragilis ſum, &amp; miſerabilis! quam procliuis adlapſum! Ignoſce mi Domine, &amp; gratiam concede, ne idem peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iterum peccem.</hi> See my Lord how fraile and miſerable I am! how prone to fall! Pardon me my Lord, and vouchſafe me thy grace, that I fall not againe into this ſinne! and after this to quiet our ſelues. This therefore did <hi>Aloyſius</hi> obſerue, &amp; he ſaid moreouer, that to be too much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for ſuch like ſinnes as theſe, was a ſigne, that a man had no true vnderſtanding of himſelfe. For he that knoweth himſelfe, could not be ignorant, that his garden of it ſelfe was only apt to bring forth thornes and briars.</p>
               <p>He imployed all his ſolicitude in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out the origene, and head of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and cogitations, till ſuch time as he had diſcouered, whether he was guilty of any fault, or no, to the intent that he might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe it to the prieſt. But when he had once
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:17839:165"/>
examined out the matter, he laid aſide all care. In his confeſſions he was cleare, ſhort, nothing anxious, and as <hi>F. Robert Bellarmine</hi> who was his <hi>Confeſsarius</hi> affirmed, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that Diuine light that was infuſed into him, and the ſharpeneſſe of his wit, he did ſo narrowly ſurucy euery ſecret corner of his mind, that he was euen as well able to expreſſe, how farre he proceeded, in euery cogitation, or deſire, or action, ſo expreſly, and diſtinctly, as if he had euen ſeene all things with his eyes. He loued very much to be publikely reprehended in the preſence of his companions, and for that cauſe he of his owne accord vſed to notifie to his Superiors his faults in a peece of paper. But at the laſt, when inſteed of rebuke he perceaued prayſe to be attributed vnto him by them, who found no fault in thoſe thinges which he condemned in himſelfe, he put on a mind to deſire thoſe reprehenſions no more, for that he ſaid, that they were rather a loſſe then a gaine vnto him.</p>

out of the filth of ſinne, to the loue of an honeſt life; but for ſo much as they were moſt apt to reuiue thoſe raked-vp fires of piety, and the ſpirit of God, in the minds of Religious men. Therfore euery yeare at what time, according to the cuſtome, they might keep their longeſt vacations from the ſchooles, to the intent that he might apply himſelfe to them, he intreated leaue for the ſpace of ſome few dayes to be retired.

He excelled in ſingular charity towards others his neighbours. Moued therewithall he often craued leaue to goe to the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls to ſerue the ſicke perſons. And when he came thither, he would make the fick-mens beds, help them with their meate, waſh their feet, ſweepe their floores, exhort ech of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to patience, and ſacred confeſſion of their ſinnes. And at home in the Colledge he dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained leaue to goe viſit the ſicke in the Infirmary.

               <p>Neither truly, according to that zeale wherwith he was vehemently inflamed for all mens ſaluation, did he leſſe readily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the care of their body, then of their ſoules. Therfore if licence might haue bene giuen him from his Superiour, conformable to that, which both in his freer courſe in the world, and alſo in Religion he had alwayes deſired, he would haue ſayled into the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt coaſts of <hi>India,</hi> to gaine Ethnicks vnto Chriſt. Moreouer, he could not as yet truly be imployed; to labour for the ſaluation of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:17839:167"/>
forraine men. For ſo much as that is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vnto them, who hauing ended the courſe of their ſtudies, &amp; being ordayned Prieſts, ordinarily are deſigned to the hearing of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſions, to the making of Sermons and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and other ſuch like offices.</p>
               <p>In the meane while he with great dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; and various art, out of that admirable pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence wherwith he was endowed from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, helped forward their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in the ſtudy of a more holy life, who were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyned with him, in the courſe &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of a Religious life. For wheras in his life which was irreprehenſible, there was ſet before them a moſt beautifull example, he moreouer asked the Rectour, whether he would be pleaſed to giue order, that at noone and night, thoſe houres, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for their recreation, they might no more intertaine talke amongſt their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of learning, and other indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (for of vayne and vnprofitable it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lawfull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) but of theſe only which were conducible to piety. There was perfect at that time ouer matters of Piety in the Colledge, <hi>F. Hyeronimus Ubaldinus,</hi> who after he had forſaken a certaine Eccleſiaſticall office which he had diſcharged in the Citty, deuoted himſelfe to the Society of IESVS, &amp; ſpent therin all the reſt of his life in notable ſanctity. Vnto this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo did <hi>Aloyſius</hi> make knowne his deſire, after it was already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the Rector, &amp; intreateth him that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:17839:167"/>
he would likewiſe add his labour to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of this that was begun, &amp; withall he offereth vp many prayers vnto Almighty God, that he would vouchſafe to bleſſe it with good ſucceſſe. After this, hauing cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of all the Colledge ſome certaine young men, all ſingularly well addicted to celeſtiall matters, whome he thought to be the fitteſt to make of his Counſell, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them togeather, and tould them that he did very much deſire, to the intent that he might profit his owne mind, at ſuch time as he had leaue to diuert his mind ſomewhat from more graue imploymentes, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelfe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, that he might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haue conference with them of Diuine matters. Moreouer, he daily, leaſt that he might ſometimes want fit matter for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, wold for the ſpace of halfe an houre, read ſome little booke of the Precepts of piety, or ſome Saints Life. To conclude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with theſe fellows he giueth a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to this matter. Therfore if he came into the company of thoſe that were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to himſelfe, he gaue the firſt onſet to this holſome diſcourſe, which the reſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailouſly ſtirred vp with his ſpeaches, did with great ioy ſecond. Vnto the prieſtes and thoſe that were Superiors vnto him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſome queſtion, and with a deſire better to informe himſelfe, he asked their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. So did he begin theſe diſcourſes of Diuine matters. Although truly, that was
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:17839:168"/>
not needfull; for ſo much as they, when they ſaw him comming vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that he was delighted with no other talke, all of them, euen the Superiours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they might comply with him, breaking of all other diſcourſe, if they had begunne it, turned to ſacred matters. When he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſed amongſt his equals, if truly they were of them, with whome he had of late ſet downe this manner of ſociety, it was no trouble to diſcourſe of holy matters: but if they were others, he doubted not of his owne accord, to begin to treat of ſome point of piety, in which they for ſo much as they were Religious men, ſeing that they deſired to profit in that courſe, did willingly ſuffer themſelues to be brought into the ſame.</p>
               <p>When any one came new from the Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or from any place elſe to follow his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he either ſet vpon him himſelfe, or ſent vnto him ſome one, with whome he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Nouiſhip, or was neere allied to in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, and as far forth as he might, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to helpe him, to conſerue that ardour of Religion which he had conceaued in his Nouiſhip. Therfore he had no ſooner ſet foot in the Colledge, but of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord he would inſinuate himſelfe into his company, and denounce vnto him, that truly if he purpoſed to remaine conſtant, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed forward in the purſuite of piety, that there ſhould not be wanting vnto him good ſtore of fellowes, who would aſſiſt him in
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:17839:168"/>
this behalfe: in the meane while, wheras he was familiarly acquainted with them all, he named vnto him fiue or ſixe of their names, who went beyond the reſt in the ſtudy and vſe of celeſtiall things. Moreouer, thoſe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> admoniſhed, that they ſhold aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with him, and it ſucceeded according to his deſire.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if he vnderſtood that any one of the Colledge was ſomewhat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue in diſcharging his duty according to the dignity of Religion, he endeauoured by all the meanes he could, to win vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe his affection, and knowing then very well truly, what occaſion of ſpeach that would giue vnto others, he daily, not only for many dayes, but euen for many weekes togeather, conuerſed with him at the noone and night meetings. So ſoone as he had now profited ſo much, in the ſtudy of perfect ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, as he required, that he might not repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t himſelfe of his payne's taken, then truly by little and little he diſmiſſed that familiarity, for ſo much as he ſaid, that he ſhould be a more vpright example to all, if he conuerſed promiſcuouſly with all: afterward he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, that he ſhould ſort himſelfe with thoſe that were the beſt, &amp; he rehearſed ſome of that quality vnto him, and alſo gaue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto them that they ſhould keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him: that he well aſſured himſelfe that he was deſirous to parti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:17839:169"/>
with one, he betooke himſelfe to another. By theſe ſo excellent endeauours, and paines taken, in a few weekes he was a help to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and he inflamed the mindes of thoſe to the loue of God who ſeemed to haue waxed the moſt cold. Therfore you might haue ſeene the whole Roman Colledge, ſo much enkindled with the burning zeale of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſpirit and piety, that there was not any one, but he would acknowledge a certaine ſingular will of God therin.</p>
               <p>I do well remember that I haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeene with theſe eyes of mine, when there were in that Colledge aboue 200. men, in the heat of the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer dayes, at ſuch time as they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eaue to recreate their minds after their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious ſtudies, in the garden, and walkes, ſome by couples, and ſome by three &amp; foure in a company walking togeather, and for ſo much as I knew the mynds of them all, it is a thing that I am well aſſured of, that there was none of all thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies, but they r co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was of God. You would ſay that they aſſembled not to recreate their mindes, but ſeriouſly to talke of diuine matters, wherby many confeſſed that they reaped no leſſe, &amp; ſome euen more fruite, then they did by their prayer it ſelfe. The which did chiefly fall out in that, for ſo much as euery one with incredible candour diſcouered thoſe heauenly comforts which they had recaued in prayer, as if one from an others light had lighted his candle. And all theſe things were

               <p>But now in the dayes of the longer vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is September and October, the young men which in the Roman Colledge apply themſelues to learning, are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themſelues from the ſchooles, to be ſent to <hi>Freſcati,</hi> to the intent that there reſting ſometime from their ſerious ſtudies they might confirme their decayed forces.

and Soliloquies of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and others in the Sermons of <hi>S. Bernard</hi> vpon the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.

Who, wheras they attributed the beginning of them to <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> as their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall authour, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him they caſt their eyes, him they highly extolled, him they piouſly imbraced, to him did they apply themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, vpon his directions did they daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. Which if they might not do, they mourned, euen as much, as if their paſſage had bene intercepted from hauing recourſe to ſome holy thing, and which was ſingular auaileable to their ſaluation and perfection of vertue. It helped forward very much to their generall loue towards him, that he was not alwayes ſo ſharpe-ſet vpon rigorous courſes, but as time, place and perſons requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he did with admirable ſuauity, prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſiderately, accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Therfore though in action he was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely ſerious, notwithſtanding in common ſociety, there appeared nothing harſh, or troble ſome in him, but meruelous courteſy, cheerfulneſſe &amp; affability towards all. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would caſt forth ſome ſharpe and witty flaſh: ſome other times he wold relate ſome pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fable, or prety ſtory for mirth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake; but neuer would he depart from that modeſty which becometh a Religious man. And this was the courſe and fruite of <hi>B. Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> his life, theſe two firſt yeares which he liued in the Roman Colledge.</p>

publike records. After he arriued at <hi>Rome,</hi> commaunded by <hi>Fa. Generall</hi> to betake him to his iourney, he firſt went to take his leaue of the Cardinalls his kinſmen. Here ſtanding in the preſence of <hi>Cardinall Roborco,</hi> and being ouercome with a ſuddaine fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-fit out of the debility of his macerated body, he was laid downe vpon the Cardinals bed.

Vnto whome he replied, that he did as yet fall ſhort of that, which his duty required.</p>
               <p>There was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him as a companion in his iourny, one of the lay-brothers, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet man, vnto whome was committed the care of <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his health; and commaund was giuen to <hi>Aloyſius</hi> himſelfe, that in all thinges truly that belonged to his health, he ſhould follow the precepts of this his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. <hi>Father Lodouicus Corbonellus,</hi> a graue man and one that had deſerued very well of the Romane Colledge, not ignorant with how grieuous head-aches <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed, perſuaded him as earneſtly as he cold, that to defend him from the ſunne he would vpon the way carry an <hi>

               <p>That day in the morning that he was to take horſe, a paire of bootes was brought into his chamber, which a certaine man of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:17839:173"/>
great dignity had worne, and that, when he was going to get them on, was tould him by a certaine perſon. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> hearing this, and fearing leaſt they ſhould be giuen him for that reſpect, gaue them to vnderſtand that he was no white at all delighted in them. Therfore as he was drawing them on, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten looked vpon them, as if he had ought for ſome occaſion to except againſt them. This his companion perceauing: what fault is there, ſaid he, in theſe bootes, do they not fit your leg? when he gaue him no anſwere: ſtay, ſaid he, I will take theſe away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, and bring you another payre that will fit you better: therfore carrying them into the next chamber, wherin the riding furniture was kept, he changed them not, but brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them backe, only wapped vp in another forme, &amp; wiſheth him to trie whether theſe perhaps may be fitter. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> ſuppoſing that they had bene another paire, when he had put them on; verily, ſaid he, theſe ſeeme to fit me very well. And afterward he made vſe of them.</p>
               <p>He went from <hi>Rome</hi> the 12. of September the yeare of our Lord 1589. togeather with <hi>Fa.

Yea verily he affirmed to a certaine companion of his, that the priuate affection of that Father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and his ſo much officious deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, did in no ſort pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>It was ſweet vnto him to ſee a far off <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> the mother or his firſt piety and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall feruour.

He doing according to his will, going to two or three houſes, which were of moſt note in that kind, brought him back-againe home.</p>
               <p>When he came to a certaine Inne, which is within the <hi>Dominion</hi> of <hi>Ferrara</hi> betweene <hi>Bolonia</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Inne-keeper allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them both a chamber which had but one bed. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his companion admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth this man priuately, that it is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Religious men to lodge no more then one in a bed.

For wheras, both her Motherly affection might haue vrged her, and no one was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent whome ſhe needed to ſtand in feare of, notwithſtanding ſhe neither kiſſed, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, but preferring veneration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Motherly loue, bowing downe her head to the ground ſhe ſaluteth him at his firſt comming. And no meruaile. For from his very childhood, ſhe held him for a Saint, and called him her Angell. All that day he beſtowed with his Mother, giuing order, that his companion ſhould be partaker and witneſſe of all thoſe ſpeaches which they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed concerning the mannaging of that cauſe. But ſo ſoone as he perceaued, that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence did ſomewhat abridge the mother from her confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in talking with her ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, taking ſome occaſion, he conueyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of doores, and betaketh him to his beades. After a certaine time returning, he findeth them both cloſe vpon their knees at prayer. In the euening all being departed to their chambers, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> demaunded of his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why he had parted from him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome he ſaid, that it ſeemed vnto him a thing very vnciuill, that wheras his mother liuing in a place ſo far diſtant, had obtained
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17839:176"/>
leaue of <hi>Father Generall</hi> to affoard her the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of her ſonne, that when he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhe might not enioy him freely, &amp; vtter her whole mind vnto him. That therfore he would willingly be preſent, as he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, when he ſpake with other Noble women, his mother only excepted. Neither did <hi>Aloyſius</hi> reply any thing to that his anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were.</p>
               <p>He continued diuers dayes at <hi>Castilion,</hi> in which he was particulerly informed from the Marqueſſe and others, of the buſineſſe and diſſentions that were betweene him &amp; the Duke of <hi>Mantus.</hi> In the meane time it is an incredible thing to declare, what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent documentes of vertue he gaue ſtill to them all, euery where vpon all oportunities: he would neuer goe through the towne but on ſoote, although it was alwayes the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, both of his mother and brother that he ſhould be attended vpon with a coach, &amp; ſo great was the concourſe of them that came to ſalute him that he was forced alwayes to goe with his hat in his hand. He dealt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly with euery one, with ſuch humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, mildneſſe, and ſubmiſsion, as if he had bene an Vnderling to them all. He neuer ſuffered himſelfe to be ſerued by any ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. If he ſtood in need of any thing, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requeſted his companions helpe. And from him truly he would admit no office, but that which was neceſſary, offered vpon the others owne accord, and in a manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:17839:177"/>
his will. For he was wont to ſerue his owne neceſsities, whilſt others without any requeſt of his, were moued euen from God to aſsiſt him. And had it not ſeemed good otherwiſe to the Superiours, that he asked counſell of, he would not haue lodged in his Mothers, or Brothers, but in the Arch-Prieſts houſe.</p>
               <p>So long as he remained at <hi>Castilion,</hi> he vſed great continency in all things. Therfore he neuer asked any thing in his mothers houſe. What ſhall I ſay? when he was oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with winter, and very could blaſts, and had need to haue cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged his garments, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he could neuer be perſuaded, that his friendes ſhould prouide them for him, but after that he had giuen the Rector of <hi>Breſcia</hi> to vnderſtand of his, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions wants, he receaued gownes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries from him, which others had worne before, for new ones he would not. His Mother intreating him very earneſtly that he would accept two <hi>Mantuan</hi> ſhirts, of which one ſhe offered to himſelfe, the other to his companion, he ſaid, it was not in his power to accept any of thoſe thinges, which with ſo free a mind he had renounced. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles ſhe ceaſed not to deale with <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> his companion, that he wold intreat him to receaue them. He commeth to him in the morning, when he was vpon the point of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and offereth him one of them, &amp; when he refuſed it: your mother, ſayth he, out of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:17839:177"/>
her loue towards God beſtoweth this vpon you, in way of almes. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> hearing the name of Almes, &amp; conſtrained by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of his companion, made no further repugnance. In like manner his other lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens, which were giuen him in the Roman Colledge at his departure, being now almoſt worne out, his mother could not obtaine, his acceptance, of a ſmall number of others, which according to her tender loue ſhe had made for him, but he rather deſired that his old ones ſhould be mended. At laſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, neceſſarily preſſing him, rehearſing likewiſe the foreſaid title of Almes, with much a doe, compelled him to take a very ſmall part of them.</p>
               <p>He neuer gaue any commaund, either to thoſe of the houſe or ſtrangers, and in that Houſe he conuerſed modeſtly and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ectly, like ſome Pilgrime or Beggar, who for Gods ſake had bene receaued into ſome Hoſpitall. When for the diſpatch of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he deſired to meet with the Marques, for ſo much as he would not interrupt him at that time, or be ſummoned at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, he ſtayed for entrance in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward chambers. At his table there was no reaſon, but that he might haue bene ſerued after the manner of other men. But in his mothers houſe, who deſired nothing more then to be obſeruing to her ſonne, challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto himſelfe more liberty, he intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that his cup might not be ſerued him v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17839:178"/>
a plate after the manner of Princes, but that according to the vſe of the Society, it might be ſet by him, vpon the table. Very ſparing were both his meat, and his drinke according to his cuſtome. Neither was he curious of what ſort they were, queſtionleſſe the daily practice of refrayning his appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, ſeemed vtterly to haue taken away his taſt. If his mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He was wont to ſay to his companion: <hi>Deus bone! quam bene nobis est domi nostrae? Mihi certè quilibet noſter, quamuis tenuis victus, maioris, quam dapes omnes, quibus hae menſae onerantur, cibi eſſe videtur:</hi> Good God! how well accommodated are we at our houſe? verily me thinketh euery diſh of ours, how ſlender ſoeuer, ſeemeth to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He would neuer ſuffer any ones help in putting on, or of his clothes; no, not ſo much as that of his companion. The Iſſue which had byn made in his left a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me, he dreſſed ſo carefully, without any ones helpe, that his companion comming in the meane time, and whilſt he endeauoureth to teach him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way how to lap it, putting his finger a little towards him, he ſtraight-way wiſhed him not to touch him. Such was his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and ſo carefull was he, not to commit to any other, that which he was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:17839:178"/>
himſelfe. In his mothers, and if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently he might, in his brothers houſe, he made his owne bed: likewiſe he readily lent his helping hand to his Companion in the making of his. But the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Court obſeruing that, were very carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent him with their diligence. He did ſo vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglect all care of his health, that he neuer ſo much as tooke it into his conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but by the admoniſhment of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. He was very much delighted with ſolitude. But he had leaſt auerſion from the company of his mother, who both was a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of piety, and ſtood in ſome need of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>In the morning, after that he was riſen out of his bed, he ſpent one whole houre in prayer; he was preſent at Maſſe, the greater Canonicall prayers he recited euery day; his beades likewiſe, and theſe ſometimes with his companion, in ſuch ſort as that they anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered one another after the manner as they vſe to ſing. If in the day time he could get any ſpare leaſure, he would ſay to his fellow, <hi>Fratereamus pauliſper precatum.</hi> Brother let vs goe a little to prayer. Before he gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to reſt, he ſaid the Litanies, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his conſcience. He confeſſed his ſinnes to the Archprieſt, and euery Feſtiuall day he went into the chiefe Church, which is that of the Saints <hi>Nazarius</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> to heare Maſle, and receaue the moſt holy Euchariſt. At which time an infinite number of people
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:17839:179"/>
reſorted, to behould him, not without ſignes of loue towards him, &amp; griefe for the loſſe of ſo good a prince. That day which he firſt came thither, the Church was filled with ſo great a multitude of men, that came to ſee him, that he was minded to haue vſed ſome ſpeach to them, and to exhort them all to feare God all the dayes of their life, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the holy Sacraments. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he abſtained, for ſo much as he thought to beginne firſt, from giuing examples of vertue, from the houſe he ſprung off, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing firſt his brothers buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>He neuer gaue any the leaſt ſharpe word to his companion, he neuer ſhewd himſelfe offended with any thing that he did, but he would rather giue place to his opinion, and with great mildneſſe ſo order his mind, that it might agree alwayes with his iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: he would giue eare vnto him in all things, that belonged to his health: and his companion admired his ſanctity, and was very much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with his candour and ſincerity, which he diſcouered in all his actions; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with that his excellency of mind, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he made no account of mortall affaires, and humane conſiderations.</p>
               <p>In that time they had made many iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies togeather, as to <hi>Breſcia, Mantua,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, whither the diſpatch of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe called them. There ſometimes vpon the way <hi>Aloyſius</hi> transferred his mind from thoſe thinges which he ſaw with his eyes,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:17839:179"/>
vnto God, and entred into good long ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Diuine matters, of which, euen when his fellow ſeemed to be wearied, or to caſt in ſome by-ſpeaches, he would make no end. This appeared once, when he was to goe to <hi>Caſtle-Godfrey,</hi> to deale with his vncle <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus,</hi> Lord of that place, whoſe inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he had ſucceded in, if he had not made choyce of Religion. At his departure the Marqueſſe commaunded certaine ſeruants to attend him, whome not preſuming in his preſence to refuſe, ſo ſoone as he was gone out of <hi>Castilion,</hi> he ſent them all from him, afterward it came to paſſe, through fault of the Coach-man who had loſt his way, that they came to <hi>Castle-Godfrey</hi> two houres after ſun-ſet, the gates being now ſhut. And for ſo much as it is a towne very well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to which no entrance at that time of night was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be allowed, the watchmen were particularly to be informed, who they were, and from whence they came, and they muſt ſtay ſo long til the Prince himſelfe was certified of all. A long time after, behold the gates are ſet open, the bridge let-downe, there iſſueth forth a great number of Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen, pages to the Prince carrying torches. In the very entrance of the towne a great company of armed men ſtanding vpon both ſides of the ſtreetes, guard him paſſing in the middeſt of them from the gate, to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pallace. The Prince himſelfe going to meet him, receaued him with great ioy and

honour. And acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panying him to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which was all decked-vp in Royall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and furniſhed with magnificent beds, he gaue place to him for a time to refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

very day, do declare certaine admirable things of his modeſty, humility, contempt of himſelfe, obſeruance and reuerence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, his incredible grauity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which was ioyned with ſingular ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and candour of mind in his conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He had his mind alwayes alienated from theſe mortall things, and placed vpon God, as one ſtraytly ioyned vnto him, in ſo much as he neither did, nor ſaid any thing, but he ſeemed to haue regard to him, as a witneſſe and ſpectatour. Therfore the Fathers beheld him as an excellent maiſter-peece of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and hauing beheld him were more and more inflamed with piety. For from his very countenance there ſhone ſo great a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of ſanctity, that they affirmed they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held therin the expreſſe image of <hi>B.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of graue and learned Fathers, what in that caſe was requiſite for him to doe. The Marques conſenting therunto, he both write to <hi>Rome,</hi> and propounded it at <hi>Millan</hi> to be decided.

When they had determined this, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> perſuadeth the Marques, to purge himſelfe of all the ſinnes of his life paſt, and to receaue the diuine Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>So ſoone as the Marques was returned to <hi>Caſtilion, Aloyſius</hi> alſo with his ſayd compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

commeth thither. When he arriued there the 20. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> he ſaid that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thither two iournies, the firſt for the world, and this for God and his Church, meaning this buſines concerning the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. He procured that the Marques ſhould openly declare to his mother, and other whome it concerned, the whole matter, how he had behaud himſelfe in it. And <hi>Aloyſius</hi> himſelfe, to the intent that he might take away all occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euill example that might ariſe herby, promulgated the ſame to the people. In like manner he exhorted his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he ſhould vſe that his wife, well &amp; Chriſtian-like. Moreouer by his letters he gaue vnderſtanding to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to both the <hi>Card Gonzaga's,</hi> who were then liuing and other Princes of his kindred, and beſought them, that what the Marques had done, for the defence of his ſoule from the danger of a grieuous ſinne, &amp; preſeruing the honour of that young woman, might not by any of them be taken in euill part. From all theſe he receaued anſwere according to his deſire. But chiefly he did his undeauour, that he might approue, and commend this fact to <hi>Alphonſus</hi> his Vncle. Wherfore after his death that dominion fell by inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to <hi>Rodulph,</hi> which after Marques <hi>Francis,</hi> who gouerneth there at this day, exchanged with the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> for that of <hi>Millan.</hi> Therfore he doth now by good right, and great power gouerne at <hi>Millan,</hi> and that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer

Being intreated by his Mother, that he would make a Sermon in the Great Church, he asked therupon the counſell of his companion. But then he made it vpon a certaine Saturday, in a Church of the Soda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity neere to the Church of <hi>S.

He ſpake elega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly and piouſly, and exhorted them all, that the next day after, which was Quinquageſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunday, the laſt of their <hi>Caruenall,</hi> they wold come to receaue the holy Euchariſt. And with ſuch ardour did they obey this his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitement, that the Prieſtes and Monkes were vpon neceſſity detained all that night in the hearing of Confeſſions. The next day in the morning there receaued the Euchariſt <hi>Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> his mother, his brother the Marques, his wife, and other people to the number of 700. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> much to his comfort, and to the ſingular example of all, ſerued the prieſt at Maſſe, and thoſe that communicated with wine.

               <p>It was his ordinary office to ſweepe downe cobwebs about the Colledge, which truly he performed very diligently.

And theſe thinges came to my mind of him at this time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſame time there was a ſpeach bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Colledge, that <hi>Aloyſius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in an admirable ability of prayer, and that whilſt he prayed he was neuer diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from God: Therfore <hi>Achilles Galiardus,</hi> a man of ſingular learning, and authority, often entring into diſcourſe with him of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall matters, at laſt alſo he fell vpon that courſe of ioyning the mind vnto God with perfect charity, which commonly they call <hi>viam vnitiuam,</hi> the vnitiue way: and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines <hi>Theologicam myſticam,</hi> myſticall Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:17839:191"/>
There he did clearly vnderſtand, that beſide other guiftes which were very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, with which his mind was ſtoared from Almighty God, he was alſo after a certaine incredible ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner cloſe ioyned to God, that he did daily reape the fruite of Myſticall Theology, that he was conuerſant about thoſe <hi>Diuinae Tenebrae</hi> of which the Great <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita</hi> ſpeaketh, that he imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, inioyed it, and proceeded very far in the ſame. Therfore finding that ſo great vertues, and thoſe of ſo high a pitch, that ſcarcely mortall condition is capable of, had taken ſo deepe rootes in a young ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mind, who had hardly paſſed foure yeares in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that he did euen now truly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe that degree, which very rare men, and thoſe of perfect and mature religion were wont to attaine to, no otherwiſe then by a certaine vnuſuall aſſiſtance of God; he tooke therin both infinite admiration and ioy.</p>
               <p>And for ſo much as, they that are ſo great proficients in this courſe of ioyning themſelues to God, do not without offering of ſome violence vnto themſelues, deſcend to the procuring of other mens ſaluation, &amp; for the moſt parte are conuerſant with God, deepe fixed vpon the contemplation of him and eſtranged from the noyſe of men: he to the intent that he might make ſome triall of him, ſaid, that he did ſomewhat merueile that this his habit of mind, was not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:17839:192"/>
ſuſpected of him, as diſagreeing with the inſtitute of the Society. For ſo much as the vocation therof is by promiſcuous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and conuerſation with all ſorts of men, to endeauour the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſoules. But this myſticall familiarity with God, by no pretext of good to others can be brought to take charge of ſoules, but leauing the care of action vnto other men, chooſeth to it ſelfe the better part which reſteth in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To this <hi>Aloyſius</hi> anſwered, that he truly if he perceaued ſuch thinges to be effected in his mind which he ſpake of, he would eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the following of them as differing from his vocation Which anſwere did euen much more aſtoniſh him. For he vnderſtood that through an admirable benefit of God, he had ioyned both courſes the one with the other, ſo that neither that which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the enioying of God, did hinder the deſire of action, nor this reſtraine the other of contemplation: and that conſequently he was placed in the higheſt ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation with God, which is performed by loue, and the perpetuall conformation of our mind to his will. To wit, the mind by force of loue being lifted vp vnto God, knowing with what zeale God burneth for the ſaluation of ſoules, being brought downe from that height, in which through bleſſed retirement it feedes vpon the cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, is vrged forward with the ſpur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherfore Almighty God declared that it was his pleaſure to ſend for him to enioy the rewards which in ſo ſhort a ſpace as that which he liued, he had with ſo much ſtudy and labour deſerued. For when as he liued yet at <hi>Millan,</hi> a litle aboue a yeare before he departed out of this life, in the time of his morning prayer when he bent the whole force of his mind vpon God, he inwardly infuſed into him a certaine light, by vertue of which he manifeſtly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that there remained but few dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more for him to liue; and moreouer he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued a commaund, that this preſent yeare

His mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing illuſtrated after this manner, he found in himſelfe a merueylous change, &amp; that his affection was much further then at any time before, withdrawne from theſe tranſitory thinges.

He cauſed to his companion celeſtiall ioy, and went before them in his example. They, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, that as far forth as he might, he deſired to be ſilent for the moſt part and that he had his mind as it were abſtracted from his ſenſes, they did their endeauour to recall him out that continuall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>A grieuous dearth of victuals at that time

infected <hi>Italy,</hi> therfore both in other places in the way, and eſpecially vpon the Apenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, which at this day deuideth <hi>Tuſcany</hi> from <hi>Lombardy,</hi> they found euery where poore men famiſhed with hunger. At the ſight of theſe a certaine Father ſaid vnto <hi>Aloyſius:</hi> verily God hath beſtowed a great benefit v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, that it was not his pleaſure we ſhould be borne in ſo great want as theſe poore men. Vnto whome he preſently anſwered; <hi>Maius verò est, quod in Turcarum ditione nati non ſumus.</hi> But greater it is, that we were not borne amongſt the Turkes. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> thought himſelfe too much obſerued by theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and according to their charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him to be vſed with too much curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Therfore he met a certaine other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and declared vnto him that he could be contented to make his iourny with other companions, that would make no account of him.</p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Siena,</hi> he deſired to receaue the Euchariſt in the Chappell of <hi>S.

There before the Bleſſed Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, meditating for a little time, without euer looking into any
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:17839:195"/>
booke, and afterward going backe into his chamber, he compendiouſly ſetteth downe thoſe thinges which he had conceaued in his mind. He made a ſermon ſo proper and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall for matter of piety, that he put into diuers of thoſe youths (who were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his place and quality) a deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne their fortunes, and imbrace Religion.

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII. <hi>Of the accomplished ſanctity of</hi> B. Aloyſius.</head>
               <p>IT is a ſentence of the Wiſeman in the booke of Prouerbes, (Pro. 4.) <hi>That the life of Iust me, which he calleth a path, is like that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plendant light, which ſpringing from the duskish light of the dawning, and white-shimering mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, doth ſtill increaſe with one degree of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe after another, til at laſt it diſplay a perfect glorious day, effected by the Sunnes arriuall to the highest point of heauen at noone-tide.</hi> Such was
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:17839:195"/>
the holy life of B. <hi>Aloyſiut.</hi> There ſtreamed forth of it euen from the very ſeauenth yeare of his age a certaine whiteneſſe of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; neither did he euer after ceaſe to acquire more and more light, as proceeding forward from one vertue to another, daily ſtill grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clearer and clearer by new merits &amp; new light fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God; till that he ſhined forth, with ſo great grace &amp; ſplend our, that he was not only growne to a perfect day, but euen as the Apoſtle ſaid of the <hi>Philippians</hi> (Phil. 2.) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelfe to be become a reſplendant light in the world. But if truly he ſhewed himſelfe ſuch in any time of his life heerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, certainely in this laſt yeare of his life, he gaue a conſpicuous teſtimony of theſe things, to them that liued familiarly with him. For there ſhined in him ſo perfect ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and ſeated with his whole mind rather in heauen, then vpon earth, he liued as it were an extaticall life, and abhorring from the ſenſe of all things that were ſubiect to Fortune.</p>
               <p>So ſoone as he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſaid vnto me, it is now a good time ſince I buried my friendes, there is no reaſon why I ſhold take any further care of them. It is high time now to thinke of another life. Not long after his comming, he bringeth to Fa. Rectour all his writings both of Diuinity and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and amongſt them certaine other Commentaries which out of his owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry he had made very learnedly vpon <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:17839:196"/>
The Rectour asking why he ſo depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe of all his writings and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe which perhaps he ſhould haue preſent vſe for? he ſaid, he did it for this cauſe, for ſo much as he perceaued himſelfe to be carried away with ſome particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards thoſe things, as the ofspring of his owne wit: and for that he ſtood not affected to any other mortall thing, he wold alſo depriue himſelfe of thoſe things, that from hence forward he might haue his mind ſequeſtred from all.</p>
               <p>Further more he had attained vnto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine exact ſubtility in trying out the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a perfect life, which were requiſite to be not only committed to memory, by all Religious people, but alſo put in execution. For there ſtealeth vpon all men for the moſt part a certaine naturall ſweetneſſe, of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing and ſelfe-cheriſhing mind, as often as they perceaue themſelues to be eſpecially graced, and beloued of excellent men, and chiefly of them in whoſe power they are, for that they by this euident teſtimony &amp; ſigne declare that they are well pleaſed with their demeanour: therfore oftentimes, ſome do not only reioyce therin themſelues, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo make mention therof in the company of their familiar friendes. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was far of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mind. For ſo far forth had he extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed all loue of himſelfe, and was ſo far from deſiring that any mans mind ſhould particularly adhere to him, that he would
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:17839:196"/>
not endure himſelfe ſo much as with any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar loue, or obſeruance to be affected by the Superiours themſelues. If any one made a ſhew to loue h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> more then any of the reſt, he would be ſo far from anſwering them with loue, that he conceaued griefe for the ſame. Therfore thoſe that gouerned him, to the intent that they might doe a thing acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to him, they ſeemed no more to eſteeme of him, then of any other.</p>
               <p>Wheras in all companies he was wont to be very affable, likewiſe at this time no man was more courteous, no man could poſſibly be of a more ſweet condition, with ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe and common a kind of charity did he imbrace all. Therfore very earneſtly they had recourſe to him in recreation time, to heare him diſcourſe of God, of celeſtiall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and of the perfection of vertue. Verily my ſelfe, ſpeake both by experience, and haue bene tould by others, that many depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his company more inflamed then from their prayers. If he could get any one vnto whome he knew that he might confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently inlarge his mind in priuate, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them ſuch diuine affections of his hart, that as men ſtroken with admiration, he cauſed them both to ſigh, and conceaue a veneration of ſo vnuſuall a coniunction with God.</p>
               <p>Whitherſoeuer he went, he neuer laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the preſence of God contemplating all his actions. He was ſo inflamed with he
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:17839:197"/>
loue of God, that when either there was mention made of him, by the Reader at the table, or by any other diſcourſe, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his mind flowed with celeſtiall ioy, and he would giue an open ſigne therof, by the inflammation of his countenance, &amp; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of his ſpeach. This fell out both at other times, and alſo once at the table, when he hearing certaine things read of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine loue, on the ſuddaine he ſenſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, from his inward breſt as it were, a flame to burſt forth, by the violence wherof he was conſtrained to forbeare eating. V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this occaſion we that ſate round about him at the table tooke notice of it. And for ſo much as we were ignorant of the cauſe, &amp; feared leaſt he was grieuouſly ſicke, we fixed our eyes attentiuely vpon him, &amp; asked him whether he were well or no. He who at that time truly was not able to vtter ſo much as one word, and found himſelfe to be taken with the manner, being ſo much the more out of countenance, caſt downe his eyes, burſt forth into teares, bluſhed, &amp; ſwelled ſo in the breſt, that we feared leaſt ſome of his veines might haue broken, &amp; were all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with commiſeration of him. At laſt in the later ending of dinner by little and little he recouered himſelfe againe. There were ſome who when they knew theſe thinges, to the intent that they might ſee him bluſh, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſet purpoſe, would in the company of their companions introduce ſpeaches of the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:17839:197"/>
charity of God towards mankind. Others contrariwiſe, leaſt he ſhould incurre ſome hurt, or troble in his body, endeauoured to breake of theſe kinds of diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>Walking in the ſchooles and cloiſters, he had his mind ſo far abſtracted from his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that vpon ſet purpoſe oftentimes paſſing by him to ſalute him, I haue take occaſion to bring him to himſelfe. There he ſaid his beades to the Bleſſed Virgin-Mother, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently vſed intercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gable offices of piety, one while kneeling, another while ſtanding vpright: and yet neuertheleſſe he auoyded that note of affectation in all his doings, which others, often doing theſe thinges, would eaſily haue incurred.</p>
               <p>This yeare he deſigned vnto himſelfe one houre euery day, for the reading of ſacred thinges. He ſeemed much to be delighted in reading the <hi>Soliloquies</hi> of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> the life of <hi>S. Catherine</hi> of <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Bernard.</hi> He had ſo often read that ouer, that he ſeemed almoſt to haue learned it without booke. In his reading, he ſelected, and noted certaine hidden ſentences of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which after his death we found written in his owne hand.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of Nouember, the yeare 1590. hauing begun his fourth yeare in the ſtudie of Diuinity, the Rectour compelled
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:17839:198"/>
him to haue his chamber a part from the reſt of his companions. Then he brought to paſſe that he might lodge in a certaine ſmall corner of the houſe, that was old, darke, low, narrow, with one window only through the roofe therof, which being iuſt ouer the ſtayres, was able to contayne no more then a poore bed, a wooden chayre, a foote ſtole which did ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it was neuer wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be allotted vnto any ſtudent. When F. Rectour ſometimes viſited him in that place, he found him triumphing and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e ſlayres, ſo he alſo like a poore man, aboue.</p>
               <p>To conclude, ſo complete was he in all the parts of Sanctity, that many both his Superiours, chamberfellows, and fellow ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents affirmed vpon oath, that by no one of them was he euer found ſo much as culpable of one veniall ſinne. He that heard his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, ſaid that he neuer diſmiſſed him, but he conceaued ſome new light by hearing his confeſſion. Another Fa. in like manner being ſworne, affirmed, that he, who had layne two yeares more or leſſe, in the ſame chamber with <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> wheras both of them were commaunded by the Rectour of the Roman Colledge, that one ſhould admoniſh

He was wont to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:17839:199"/>
other things, that how much the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his life was prolonged, ſo much the more feare was he in, of his ſaluation. Therefore if there ſhould happen vnto him a long life, and by the increaſe of yeares he ſhould be likewiſe intangled with greater buſineſſes, &amp; that he ſhould be initiated in prieſthood, he ſhould be euen much more vncertaine of it. The reaſon he gaue was this: for that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God requireth an exact account of prieſtes, whoſe office is to ſay determinate prayers, and celebrate maſſes; and that they who take care of other mens ſoules, ought much more by pennance, to cleanſe their owne; that they make holy Sermons, that they miniſter the ſacraments, and that they gouerne others: but that now in the ſtate in which he then was, when as he was not yet preferred to any ſacred orders, nor ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any important buſineſſes, and therfore was yet freed from the occaſions of diuers ſinnes, he had a better hope of making a good end; that therefore being of thoſe you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g yeares he did nothing at all feare death if it might ſo ſtand with Gods pleaſure.

               <head>CHAP. XXIX. With great Charity he ſerueth the ſick in the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Thereby he is infected with a deadly diſeaſe.</head>
               <p>THE yeare 1591. was very contagious through a cruell plague, which famine ſpread throgh all Italy, inſuing euery where after that generall dearth of corne. Heerof at <hi>Rome</hi> dyed an infinite number of men, who out of hope of reliefe had flocked thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all bordering Countries. This common calamity the Fathers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of IESVS, did with all help and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, partly out of their owne ſtock, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered from other mens liberalityes, labour to relieue. Therefore they did not only induſtriouſly apply themſelues to the Hoſpitalls of that Citty, but moreouer, things being driuen to extreme neceſſity, by <hi>Fa. Claudius Aquauiua</hi> the Generall his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they in tyme opened away vnto a new one. And Father Generall himſelfe, euen ſubiected his owne ſeruice to thoſe that were infected with the Leproſy.</p>
               <p>At which tyme B. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> by begging victualls through the Citty very cheerfully for thoſe that were ſicke and needy, by his ſingular charity cauſed great admiration to all that beheld him. But then eſpecially, when (vnderſtanding that a certayne ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noble Prince, who from his Childhood
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:17839:200"/>
had beene friendly and familiar vnto him, &amp; whome he had perceaued to harbour ſome ſparkes of piety, came to <hi>Rome</hi> to negotiate ſome buſineſſe with <hi>Gregory</hi> that 14. then Pope) he deſired leaue of Fa. Generall to ſalute him in a patched coate, with a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let vpon his ſhoulders. For firſt he ſayd that his hope was he would be bountifull to the poore people that lay in the Hoſpitalls; and further for that he had alwayes found him a great well wiſher of his, it was requiſite, that with ſome pious office he ſhold requite him. Moreouer that he thought it would not be amiſſe for the informing of his mind with a holſome contempt of all mortall thinges, to goe to viſit him in that poore habit. Hauing intreated leaue, he obtayned both, as the Princes mayſter of his houſhould tould me afterward. For he brought away no ſmall ſumme of money in almes for the poore, &amp; the Prince himſelfe at the behoulding of him being moued with a laudable griefe, and ſtirred vp with good thoughts, proſecuted this his humiliation with ſpeaches full of piety.</p>
               <p>Moreouer wheras he had earneſtly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in this courſe of going to the Hoſpitalls and ſeruing the ſicke perſons, he neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from a certaine holy emulation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging the examples of his fellows, vnto whome the ſame was graunted, before he had obtained leaue of his Superiours, who were very hard to be intreated therunto. He
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:17839:200"/>
went therfore, and that very often togeather with his fellows, among whome was one <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius Bondius.</hi> When ſome one admoniſhed this man, that he ſhould take heed leaſt he tooke ſome infection, he anſwered, that he, who had before his eyes ſo bright an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> neither would, nor could be terrified from that labour by any danger of death that could be obiected. This <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> about that time, perceaued a certaine vnuſuall feruour of a diuine ſpirit to be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted vnto him: they who knew him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, both merueiling, and congratulating this his alacrity, and new feruour of mind. And he himſelfe firſt tooke his death by this diſeaſe, as we will ſtraightway recount.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that went to the ſicke perſons were alwayes accompanied with a Prieſt, who might heare their confeſſions. And chiefly <hi>Fa. Nicolas Fabrinus</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> being at that time the Miniſter of the Roman Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a man of great iudgment and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in charity and other Religious vertues. He, wheras he was inwardly acquainted with <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> afterward when he gouerned the <hi>Florentine</hi> Colledge, committed to writing thoſe thinges which happenned to <hi>Aloyſius</hi> both in the Hoſpitals, &amp; in his laſt ſickneſſe. Verily it was a horrible thing to ſee the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men creeping to the Hoſpitals, ſtinking and loathſome, and ſometimes to behould them giuing vp their laſt breath in corners, or fallen downe dead at the foote of ſome
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:17839:201"/>
payre of ſtaires. But truly in <hi>B. Aloyſius,</hi> and his companions, there ſhined forth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine abſtract of that loue; wher with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of heauen are ioyned amongſt themſelues. For they would vncloth &amp; ſhift the ſicke perſons, waſh their feete, make their beds, lay them downe in them, giue them meate, inſtruct them in the ſacred matter of pennance, and exhort them to ſuffer their paines patiently. And the Father, whome a little before I commended, obſerued, that <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was alwayes wont to be moſt about them, that were of the moſt loathſome, in ſuch ſort, that he ſeemed very hardly to be drawne from them. Whilſt they are thus bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily imployed, in the ſeruice of theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſtreſſed people, according to their Chriſtian Charity towards them, the plague, for ſo much as it was very contagious, ſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth vpon ſome of <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his companions: of which firſt, as I rehearſed before, <hi>Tiberius Bondius,</hi> being piouſly enured by <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> ſodainely departed.

He ſaid to a certaine Father that contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him, that he ſpake it for this reſpect, for that he had now ſome probable reaſon
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:17839:201"/>
to confide that he was in Gods grace; what herafter he ſhould be, he knew not. And therfore that he was willing now to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe death.</p>
               <p>Neither was it long but that God heard his prayer. For when his Superiours had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden him to returne againe to that Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall, in which they now ſaw many infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with grieuous ſickneſſe, and he out of his loue to ſanctity made no ſuite for leaue to goe thither againe; there was liberty graunted vnto him, that he might goe to the Hoſpitall of <hi>Conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> in which for the moſt part, there were none whoſe diſeaſes were infectious. Neuertheleſſe he preſently fell into the ſame diſeaſe, and betooke himſelfe to his bed the third of March, the yeare 1591. With which diſeaſe ſo ſoone as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued himſelfe to be oppreſſed, ſuppoſing according to that knowledge that he had from God at <hi>Millan,</hi> that it ſhould be his laſt, he abounded with incredible ioy, and ſhewed the ſame both in his countenance, &amp; in all his behauiour. And they vnto whome he imparted this reuelation which he had at <hi>Millan,</hi> did by this his great ioy, imagine that he would ſhortly end his life. Neither were they deceiued herin. When he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe inflamed with ſo great a deſire to dye, he began ſome what to feare, leaſt the ſame might be too immoderate. Therefore to the intent that he might he reſolued herin, he asked counſell of <hi>Fa. Bellarmine</hi> who had the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:17839:202"/>
charge of his conſcience. But after he was giuen to vnderſtand by him, that the loue of death proceeding out of a deſire to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with God, ſo that we would be willing to reſt in the power of God, was nothing hurtfull; and that it was a vſuall thing with many that flouriſhed in ſanctity, both in our memory, and in times paſt; then truly he dedicated himſelfe with his whole mind to thinke of an eternall life. Such was the violence of his diſeaſe, which was thought to be a peſtilent feuer, that with in the ſpace of ſeauen dayes, it brought him to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt point of death. Therefore when he had carefully and piouſly, as poſſibly he could, cleanſed his ſoule by confeſſion, he was by Fa. Rectour fortified with his ſacred <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi> and Extreme-vnction, he reciting with very great ſenſe of piety his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med prayers, and they that were preſent all weeping for the loſſe of ſo deere, and holy a brother.</p>
               <p>But for ſo much as whilſt he was yet in perfect health, many of his familiar friendes, out of their loue towards him, did often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue him, for ſo much as he ſeemed with ouer much auſterity both of body and mind to haſten his death, &amp; preſaged that of him, which we read to haue happened to <hi>S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> that euen at the very end of his life he would repent himſelfe, of this immoderate ardour. That he might exempt them all from this feare, hauing now receaued that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iaticum,</hi> his chamber being full of his companions, he requeſteth Fa. Rectour, that he wold poſitiuely affirme in his behalfe to them all, that in this reſpect truly he was not touched with any the leaſt ſcruple; but that he was rather ſorv that he had omitted many puniſhmentes, for which he might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily haue obtained leaue of his Superiours. That if he had bene obedient to their wills, his conſcience ſhould reſt free from all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. That moreouer, he had neuer done any thing according to his owne will, but all things by their permiſſion. He added like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this, that he was not troubled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for hauing at any time violated any one rule of his Religious courſe. Which was therefore ſaid by him, leaſt he ſhould leaue in any ones mind, any offence or occaſion to take any euill example, who had ſeene him doe any thing more, or beſides the cuſtome of others. All which things very much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their mindes.</p>
               <p>Father Prouinciall entring into him, he intreated him, to giue him leaue to make a diſcipline: who ſaying, for ſo much as he was ſo weake, he could not haue ſtrength to whip himſelfe; yet at leaſt, ſaid he, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

faw himſelfe fruſtrated of this likewiſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he very inſtantly intreated this one thing, that he might haue leaue to dye not in bed, but layed on the ground.

It was now in a manner likely that he would that day, which was the ſeauenth of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, haue ended his life, vpon which very day he was iuſt 23. yeares of age.

               <p>In the beginning of his ſickneſſe the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian</hi> had commaunded, that he, and likewiſe another who was ſicke of the like diſeaſe, ſhould drinke a very bitter potion: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did his endeauour, to the intent that he might auoyd the noy ſomeneſſe of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſup it off ſuddainly, vſing alſo other accuſtomed helpes; but <hi>Aloyſius</hi> to the intent that he might make vnto himſelfe a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome trouble, dranke it vp all, by degrees, as

if it had bene ſome very ſweet liquour, and gaue no ſigne of euer perceauing any bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The Infirmarian in his chamber vpon the table had placed, a little Sugar-candy, and iuyce of liquoriſh to helpe him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt the diſtillation of his rheume.

               <p>When it was giuen him to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that there was great danger of a plague to enſue that yeare, he did not only manifeſt to his Superiour, that, if he recouered his health, he would be willing to ſerue them that were infected with the ſame, but alſo requeſted leaue of <hi>Fa.

By thoſe words the good Cardinal being moued to teares, anſwered, that truly rather him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ought, notwithſtanding the difference of their ages, acknowledge him the parent and maiſter of his piety. After this he declared vnto him, how great profit &amp; cleſtiall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his words and examples had alwayes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to his mind. At his departure profeſſing to his followers, that the loſſe of that young man would be an infinite griefe vnto him, he ſaid, that he neuer departed from diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with him, but with his mind diſpoſed to

That Father his ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kneſſe being now increaſed vpon him, ſome eight dayes before his death, beſought the Infirmarian that he would bring to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his chamber, <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> who now through want of ſtrength was not able to ſtand vpon his legges. And this he did, for that he now held <hi>Aloyſius</hi> for a Saint. The infirmarian ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this thing ſo acceptable to the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he put on <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his cloathes and carried him into the Fathers chamber. It is incredible how much this his comming to viſit him, did recreat the good old man, and what ſincere contentment, and motions of piety he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by behoulding him; After they had talked togeather, they exhorted each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to beare patiently this their aduerſity, and to obey the will of God. The old man ſaid: farewell, my deere brother <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> it is now but a ſhort ty me, that I haue to liue, neyther ſhall we ſee one another agayne. There is one ſuite that I haue to you, I pray you deny me not.

and partly abaſhed at this his petition, ſayd that that was not fit for him to doe, for to bleſſe was the office of a Superiour, and that he was aged, himſelfe young he a Prieſt, &amp; himſelfe not ſo. But this old man, ſuch was his pious affection towards this holy young man, perſiſted agayne to vrg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He likewiſe intreated the Infirmarian that he would not take him away, before he had condeſcended to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Notwithſtanding this diſcreet young man withſtood it, and would not be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, till he was compelled by the Infirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. And then he found a way, by which he might both mitigate the griefe of the ould man, and preſerue his owne humility. For taking vp his hand, and ſigning himſelfe in forme of a croſſe; he ſayd, <hi>Deus D. N. nobis ambobus benedicat:</hi> our Lord God bleſſe vs both.

               <p>There are ſome who recount, that <hi>Aloyſius</hi> propheſied, that this Father ſhould depart out of this life before him. The which came to paſſe accordingly. For he dyed vpon the firſt day of Iune, being Whitſunday-Eue, at twelue of the clocke in the night, twen ty dayes before <hi>Aloyſius</hi> made his happy end. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his chamber was ſo farre from the chamber of this Father, that he was the length of a whole gallery diſtant from him, and ſo conſequently could by no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes haue vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of his being in danger of death, and yet he imagined that thrice that night he ſaw him.

Truly but ill, ſayd he, for after an vnuſuall manner, I haue bene trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with dreames, or rather viſions.

Being awaked and ſuppoſing it to be a dreame: It were better (ſayd I to my ſelfe by way of reprehenſon) for thee to ſleepe: wherfore driue away theſe fancies. A little after being but newly fallen a ſleepe, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth agayne vnto me, importuning more vehemently then before, that I would aſſiſt him with my prayers in that his ſo great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, which ſeemed to him allmoſt intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. Againe I am rouſed out of my ſleepe, agayne I blame my owne reſtleſſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and determine with my ſelfe to aske leaue the next day to expiate with ſome pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance this my negligence in fulfilling the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But at another time vpon ſome occaſion giuen, he gaue them to vnderſtand, that he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely aſſured, that he was not only dead, but that he was euen entred into heauen. Wherupon <hi>Fa. Pobert Bellarmine</hi> asking him, what he thought of his ſoule, whether it were detained yet in the fire of purgatory or no? Verily, he anſwered confidently, that without any delay it paſſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Purgatory. By which anſwere he coniectured, that he had it reuealed vnto him from God. For wheras he was of his owne nature infinitely conſiderate in all his ſpeaches, and ſparing in the affirmation of doubtfull things, he wold neuer, vnleſſe he had bene certified from God, haue ſo clearly aſſured his Ghoſtly-Father, that he had now paſſed Purgatory.</p>

All this time we all beſought him, with as exquiſite reaſons as we could, that he would pray to almighty God that his life might be enlarged, for by that meanes he might come at laſt to heauen full-fraught with infinite acceſſe of merits, and that he might render more profit to men, and principally to the Society.

For then changing himſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to diſcours, he made ſhew not only to be recreated, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exhilarated. Of this his cuſtome, this reaſon he gaue, was, that allthough he nothing doubted, but that it was no way differing, from the courſe of a Religious man, to ſpeake in conuerſation, prudently of indifferent matters for piety ſake, notwithſtanding at that time remaining in that ſtate, it was requiſite, and he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that God did expect it at his hands, as his peculiar right, that of all his diſcourſes, not only the forme (for ſo he tearmed it) to wit the intention of his mind, ſtill regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (as alwaies it ought) the honor of God, but euen the matter it ſelfe of them ſhould be ſacred. And euery little moment of time, which Almighty God did vouchſafe him, in that latter ending of his life, he did valew a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He ſomtimes would requeſt them to helpe him on with his cloathes, &amp; going out of his bed, would creepe after his feeble manner to the table, vpon which there ſtood the image of Chriſt crucified, which he imbracing would kiſſe In like manner he did to the picture of <hi>S.

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:17839:211"/>
Saints wherwith his chamber was hanged. And for ſo much as one of the Infirmiers ſaid, that he needed not to riſe out of his bed, for that he would bring the crucifix &amp; other pictures to his bed-ſide. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, theſe are my ſtations. Therfore he held on that cuſtome ſo long as he was able to get out of his bed, moreouer, in the day time when the doore of his chamber being ſhut he was priuate, without the helpe of any one, he did ſteale out of his bed, &amp; betweene that &amp; the wall caſt himſelfe vpon his knees, and ſo long applied himſelfe to his prayers til he heard ſome noyſe at the doore. For then he roſe vp, as if he would returne to his bed. The Infirmier for a certaine time ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that he had riſen to performe the needs of nature, at laſt when he found him often gone out of his bed, ſuſpecting that which was the truth after that he had once ſtolne vpon him, and found him vpon his knees, he forbade him to attempt it any more. He, when he ſaw himſelfe taken with the manner, verily bluſhed, and after that, abſtained from that which was forbidden him.</p>
               <p>He often at this time asked Counſell of <hi>F. Robert Bellarmine</hi> concerning his ſoule mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who was his Ghoſtly Father. And one euening he asked him whether he thought that any one did euer goe to heauen vntou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the fire of Purgatory? he anſwered, that verily he thought there did, being not
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:17839:211"/>
ignorant how much he might promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his vertue: And more then that, I do confidently perſuade my ſelfe, ſaid he, that you ſhall be one of thoſe who free from Purgatory goe ſtraight to heauen. For wheras God in token of his goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, hath adorned your mind, with ſo many giftes and endowments, as you haue pleaſed to acquaint me withall, of which that is not to be thought the meaneſt that it was his pleaſure you ſhould be alwaies free from mortall ſinne, verily I do aſſuredly hope, that he will add this, for the accompliſhment of all, that without all delay you ſhall ſpeed to heauen. At this ſame anſwere he was ſo much ouerioyed, that his mind being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from his ſenſes, he was tranſported, to behould the bliſſe of that celeſtiall cirty, being diſcouered vnto him by God.

               <p>It was his care, to ſpend the eight laſt dayes of his life, in certaine ſingular offices of piety and Religion.

and the recommendation of his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin Mother, did verily hope that it would ſhortly ſo come to paſſe. That he did faythfully promiſe, and wiſh't him to make no queſtion, but that his firme purpoſe was to negotiate for him.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charge only was giuen to Father Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, togeather with another companion in like manner a Prieſt, to be carefully aſſiſting about him. There is no man but may well imagine, with what ſenſe of loue and griefe we were ſeparated, from a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion ſo deere vnto vs all, whome we were certainely aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red we ſhould neuer more ſee liuing.

But they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt they might haſten his death, and with all ſuppoſing that this requeſt of his might rather come from ſome naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then aduiſedly from himſelfe, for ſo much as they reſolued not to meddle with him, they exhorted him to call to mind, that hard and narrow bed, vpon which in the middeſt of ſo many anguiſhes and torments.

               <head>CHAP. XXXIV. <hi>Of the obſequies, buriall, and thoſe things which happened to the body of</hi> B. Aloyſius.</head>
               <p>VERILY thoſe ſame two prieſtes ſeeme to haue receaued a great benefit from Almighty God, who were preſent at his death, that out of ſo great a number which with ſo ardent deſires made ſute for that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, they ſhould eſpecially be choſen, to ſee a young man of ſo great ſanctity, happily paſſing towards heauen, which was to them ſo much the more comfortable, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure, he had promiſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them whilſt they were liuing, vnto Almighty God. Fa. Miniſter was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a certaine quiet reſt, and celeſtiall ſweetneſse: his companion was ſurpriſed with a certaine vnuſuall ardour &amp; holſome griefe, and with a deſire of honouring God according to the inſtructions of <hi>B. Aloyſius.</hi> Which mind of his abounding with many teares, he retained, not only many moneths, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many yeares, if not ſo vehement as when his griefe was freſh and greene, yet ſtill more or leſse, according as occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But for ſo much as his piety incited him to teare away, for himſelfe, ſome of this Bleſsed you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gmans reliques, reuerence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him, that he wold not lay violent hold of any thing that belonged to his body, but made ſure for the latchets of his ſhoos, the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:17839:219"/>
pennes wherwith he was wont to write, and other things of the like kind, and preſerueth them euen at this very time that I write this.</p>
               <p>The Infirmarians when they came to waſh and take charge of his body, lifting vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame prieſtes the ſheetes of his bed, found that braſen Crucifix, which, as we haue ſaid before, he had continually held cloſe to his breſt for three dayes togeather. When they ſtripped his body naked, they found a very thick hardned skinne vpon his knees, which his perpetuall cuſtome of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon his bare knees from his childhood had ſettled vpon them, of which, ſome cutting of ſome little peeces, keepe to this day as a pious monument. One of the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians, by the inſtigation of ſome that had him in great honour, attempting to cut ſome little peece of his fleſh, ſtraight repenting himſelfe of his enterpriſe, tooke only away ſome little part of his skinne, with which he recounteth that a ſicke perſon being by his aduiſe touched, was reſtored to his health.</p>
               <p>When he had but euen newly giuen vp his laſt breath, one of thoſe Fathers, which were preſent, certified ſome of thoſe who whilſt he liued were his moſt intimate friendes, that this our Angell was ſoared vp to Heauen. Who being inkindled with feruorous piety, threw themſelues out of their beds, &amp; partly (for that they thought him already enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in thoſe happy dwellings of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly citizens) they began to inuocate him,
<pb facs="tcp:17839:219"/>
partly they offered vp their prayers for him, which in the Name of friendſhip he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted of them before his death. The next morning being the 21. of Iune, ſo ſoone as euer the riſing-bell was but ſcaicely rung, the chamber where that ſacred body was placed, was full of company, and all falling vpon their knees, either inuocated God for his ſoule, or (which was the far greater part of them) made interceſſion to him for their owne. Moreouer, happy were they that cold but firſt lay hold of, with a pious affection, his ſhoos, his ſhirt, his ſhooties, and other his garments. His nailes, his haire, &amp; ſome parts of his fleſh were cut of. From thence, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was brought into the publike chappell of the Colledge, all the houres before noone it was frequented by very many, eſpecially of thoſe young men of his acquaintance, who before were not only afrayd to touch, but euen to be hould a dead body, went to the beare, &amp; redoubling this word <hi>Sanctus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi> ſtroue to imbrace, and kiſſe thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred reliques. That very morning, all the Maſses both in the Colledge, and in other houſes of the Society in that Citty were ſaid for his ſoule, although it was done by moſt, more to continue that cuſtome of the Society, then for that they thought he had any need of them.</p>
               <p>It is hard for them that were not eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this thing, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue in their min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, how much his departure moued the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:17839:220"/>
minds of all thoſe that liued in that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For no one was willing to ſpeake of any thing but his vertue and ſanctity, whilſt ech one declared ſeuerally, what ſoeuer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular example they had obſerued in him. But far more frequent was he in their harts then in their mouthes, euery one reuoluing in his mind, of how ineſtimable a iewell they were depriued, what a loſſe that day they had ſuſtained of his holy ſociety.</p>
               <p>About an houre before ſun ſet, when the Dirige &amp; funerall praiers were to be ſaid, the ſacred body was brought out of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell into the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>all, where the Fathers &amp; all the other fellows were aſſembled. There euery one of them, euen the prieſts themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues by turnes, before it was carried forth, kiſſed his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Which kind of veneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wont to be exhibited only vnto prieſtes, was attributed to the ſanctimony of this young man, who was initiated only in the <hi>Ordines minores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This office being performed, his funerall went forward with a long traine to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Church of the Colledge, called that of the <hi>Annunciata,</hi> &amp; there the funerall prayers were celebrated according to the cuſtome. After which there was ſo great a concourſe, of young men who were Students there, and of other people who encompaſſed the hearſe, to worſhip &amp; take vnto themſelues of thoſe holy reliques, that the Fathers being not now able to withſtand them, were
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:17839:220"/>
conſtrained to ſhut the Church-doores a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. In the meane time; his hayre, his nayles, his inward and outward garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, were cut; his fingers ends, and two iointes of the little finger of his right hand were cut of. There were preſent alſo certaine Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious men, as <hi>Franciſcus Dietrichstine,</hi> who at this day is <hi>Cardinall</hi> of the holy Roman Church <hi>Benedictus</hi> &amp; <hi>Philip Caietan, Iuli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinus, Maximilianus Pernestainius, a Bohemian</hi> Lord, who afterward dyed one of the Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamberlaines of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII.</p>
               <p>When he was there ready to be buried, it ſeemed good both to other Fathers of great authority, and chiefly to <hi>F. Robert Bellarmine,</hi> that he ſhould not be buried after the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, but coffined vp after ſome peculiar manner. For ſo much as hauing paſſed his life in ſo ſingular ſanctity, they nothing doubted, but how much the more careful he had been in his life time to obſcure himſelfe from the knowledge of men, ſo much the more cleare in time to come, would God make his glory to ſhine throughout the whole world. But wheras in that place it is the cuſtome not to include mens bodies of the Society in coffins, but bury the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſome graue without any curioſity, the Rectour ſent Father Miniſter to the houſe of the Profeſſed, to the intent that he might aske counſell of <hi>Fa.

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:17839:221"/>
matter with <hi>Fa. Generall,</hi> himſelfe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it ſhould be incloſed in a coffin: For ſo much as <hi>Fa. Generall</hi> did for that cauſe, willingly diſpenſe with this young man in that cuſtome ſince there was no one vnto whome his ſanctity was not very well knowne; that it may euen hereby appeare, that he who like one of the inhabitants of Heaue was honoured w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th an vnuſuall kind of buriall, did euen then flouriſh with a certaine ſingular prayſe of celeſtiall vertue. Therefore being put into a coffin that was prepared for him, in the Chappell that taketh the Name of Chriſt-Crucified, which at the entrance of the great doore is vpon the left hand, it was put into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vault, which is next to the publike ſtreete, at that ſide, at which the Goſpell is wont to be read. For many dayes after at all common aſſemblies, there was no other diſcourſe, then of the vertue of this holy young man. And they that liued in that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge being now depriued of him liuing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to worſhip him dead. Therfore no day paſſed, but ſome one or other went to his monument, and ſaluted him with long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. In which cuſtome very many perſeuered many moneths, and euen many yeares, whilſt they ſpent their time at <hi>Rome.</hi> Amongſt theſe was <hi>Fa. loannes Antonius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>altrinus,</hi> who though he had neuer bene acquainted with him liuing, when a little after his death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of <hi>Siçily,</hi> he had read thoſe things
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:17839:221"/>
which I had written of his life, he burned with ſo much affection towards him, that he did not only daily viſit his tombe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſtrow it with flowers of diuers kinds, which he gathered out of the garden, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the very flowers did mourne for this Bleſſed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who had flouriſhed with the endowment of ſo many exquiſite vertues.</p>
               <p>The body of B. <hi>Aloyſius</hi> remained in that Coffin ſeauen whole yeares, namely til the yeare of our Lord 1598. when, leaſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time it might be mingled with other bodies, by order giuen from. <hi>Clandius Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>iua</hi> the Generall, his bones vpon the 22. day of Iune the yeare 1598. were tranſlated, from the old Coffin into another leſser one, and in the wall of the ſame vault which is next to the ſtreet, placed ſomewhat on high. There by permiſſion of Father Prouinciall, who himſelf was preſet at the performing of this worke, certaine partes of his reliques being taken out, were diſperſed into many citties of <hi>Italy,</hi> and carried into <hi>Polonia,</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> Moreouer Fa. Prouinciall tooke ſome of them to himſelfe, and gaue other ſome to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Neither will I heere let paſse that the ſame Prouinciall did affirme, that his bones were found ioyned togeather, in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt faſhion, with his head ſubmiſſiuely bowing, in the which for the moſt part he accuſtomed to be whilſt he liued; which thing made a notable impreſſion of piety in them that beheld it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:17839:222"/>
But ſome yeares after, when God by the mediation of his prayers, began by the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of Miracles, to diſcouer his ſanctity vnto men, the ſame <hi>Fa. Generall</hi> ordained, that his holy bones taken out of that place of buriall, ſhould be placed in another more decent apart from others. Therfore the 8. of Iune 1602. it was brought priuately into the Veſtiary, and after agayne vpon the firſt day of Iuly next inſuing, it was placed in a leaden Coffin, which was put within the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wooden one, vnder the ſtep of <hi>S. Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> Altar, which is in the ſame Church. And although care was taken, that theſe things excepting thoſe that laboured in the worke it ſelfe, ſhould be carried very cloſely from all others; notwithſtanding ſuch was the pious diligence of the people in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that they found, where that ſacred treaſure was of late beſtowed. At laſt the fame of his ſanctity increaſing throughout the whole world, and by his interceſſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God many miracles being wrought, at the requeſt of <hi>Francis Gonzaga</hi> the Marques of <hi>Castilion,</hi> the Emperours Embaſſadour, a moſt excellent Prince, who thought that place too meane for him, <hi>Father Generall</hi> commaunded againe that the Coffin ſhould be taken vp, and it being by order from the Superiours opened, the Marques made choyce of ſome of the Reliques for himſelfe and the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> His head by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund from <hi>Fa.

They la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured indeed to tranſport it very ſecretly; but the Embaſladour, togeather with his wife had no ſooner entred the Church; as in like manner the Duke of <hi>Poli,</hi> and other chiefe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that there flocked in ſo great a multitude, that it began preſently to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

Before others <hi>Fa. Claudius Aquauina</hi> the Generall, did aſsure her that from hence-forward, ſhe might haue recourſe to him as to a deere &amp; faythfull patron in heauen, for ſo much as it was confidently thought, that that happy, &amp;
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:17839:224"/>
diuinely fortunate ſoule, did euen then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy eternall felicity; neither would he euer ceaſe to help and comfort him, togeather with the reſt of his companions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Father Rectour of the Roman Colledge certified her, that <hi>Aloyſius</hi> was paſſed to a more bleſſed life, not only in his ſoule, but euen in his countenance, and whole body ſo quiet and compoſed, that he had excited a deſire in all to imitate his death, which was correſpondent to his life, moſt holily lead, and endowed with all kind of vertues. And that therfore ſhe and the reſt of the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſhold not ſo much grieue for his loſse, as reioyce that one of their kindred was transferred to the number of the Saints.</p>
               <p>The ſelfe ſame teſtimony haue many moſt Illuſtrious men giuen by their letters. And eſpecially <hi>Hieronymus Roboreus</hi> that moſt Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Cardinall wrote to the ſame No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lady in this manner. <hi>The last thurſday in the night was our good Father</hi> Aloyſius <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to a more happy life; and ſuch a harty affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of him, and opinion of his egregious ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony hath he left vnto others, that thoſe Fathers his companions being confident, that he shineth gloriouſly in heauen, haue attended his death with no leſſe admiration then teares.

               <p>To the ſame effect were the letters of Cardinall <hi>Scipio Gonzaga,</hi> which he ſent to the Biſhop of <hi>Mantua</hi> his brother, and to <hi>Aloyſius</hi> his mother.

Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily I grieue that we are bereft of the aſpect of ſo eminent a man, and that you must be liable to a griefe, then which I make a question whether any can be greater, for that in this his last ſickneſse you had no oportunity to ſee him, no not ſo much as once in the last cloſing vp of his life. But him ſurely I congratulate, as hauing with his excellent offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſanctity whilst he liued, merited heauen, whither, by the constant opinion of all he did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fly then goe, ſo remarkable a feeling of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished vertue, did he leaue behind him both to</hi> Rome, <hi>and the whole world beſides.

               <head>CHAP. III. Many miracles of <hi>B. Aloyſius.</hi> He recouereth his mother from the point of death. He procureth a happy deliuery to a noble woman much indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in child-birth. He deliuereth a certaine man from danger of looſing his ſight.</head>
               <p>IT was not truly my intention, when firſt I applied my mind to the writing of this hiſtory, to make any collection of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and benefits wrought by God in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, through the merits and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> after his death, but only to relate his ſingular actes of piety and vertue, which with Gods aſſiſtance, there is no one but may very well imitate. For verily out of the commendation of his miracles, there will reſult no great increaſe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his ſactity, eſpecially in the minds of them, who had any commerce or familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with him in his life time. For in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of intelligent and learned men, thoſe celeſtiall guiftes wherwith liuing he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, were of more account, then the power of working miracles. According vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which a certaine prieſt of notable wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who hauing read the actes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his ſanctity, was intreated by the Superiours, that he would ſet downe his opinion of them, wrote expreſly in theſe words. <hi>My iudgment is, that this your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was a very holy man, and very worthy to be
<pb facs="tcp:17839:229"/>
reduced into the number of the Saints. For thoſe giftes giuen him from God, ſeeme to me of more moment, then if he had raiſed the dead to life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to the intent that this ornament alſo may not ſeeme wanting vnto him, I will here proſecute in ſome few chapters, thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of God, and miracles, which after his death by publike authority, I found regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in tables, and confirmed by the oathes of ſufficient witneſſes. For thoſe thinges which are ſaid to haue bene done whilſt he liued, I will of ſet-purpoſe conceale.</p>
               <p>The yeare 1593. when Marques <hi>Rodulph</hi> (vnto whome <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> had yielded vp his dominion) being dead at Caſtle-<hi>Godfrey,</hi> the which a little before was by inheritance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued to his dominion, the towneſmen had entred into armes; the mother of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques himſelfe &amp; of <hi>B. Aloyſius,</hi> a moſt choyce woman, apprehended ſo ſharpe a griefe, by troble of mind which ſhe conceaued therby, that ſhe fell into into a very grieuous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Which within a few dayes brought her into the vtmoſt danger of her life. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing receaued the heauenly <hi>Viaticum,</hi> and Extreme-vnction, it was verily thought that ſhe would ſhortly giue-vp her laſt breath, when behold being perfectly awake ſhe ſeeth her Bleſſed ſonne <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> ſtanding before her bed in a certaine immortall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and illuminated with much light, with w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſe preſence and aſpect ſhe was ſo much recreated, that wheras before being oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:17839:230"/>
and vtterly dishartned, ſhe could not ſo much as ſheed one teare; behoulding now her delicious darling, ſhe was ſo far forth moued, that ſhe wept ſweetly, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a hope, not only to recouer her health, but alſo to ſee againe the flouriſhing ſtate of her children. After he was vaniſhed out of her ſight, beyond the opinion of all men ſhe recouered her health, and dayly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward became a happy ſpectatour, of the ſucceſſefull increaſe of Marques <hi>Francis</hi> his fortune, who at this day gouerneth the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſate. Therfore the firſt miracle done by this Bleſſed man after his death, was the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this pious office to his mother. This admirable viſion, both the Marques him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe related vnto me at <hi>Caſtilion,</hi> and the Counteſſe <hi>Laura Gonzaga Martinenga</hi> at <hi>Breſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and alſo it was afterward ratified by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall writings.</p>
               <p>A certaine Noble Lady, very remarkable for piety, being in Child-birth, oppreſſed with very ſharpe panges, and hauing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wraſtled with many bitter and mortall throbbes, when at laſt she had voyded forth a great quantity of bloud, all her naturall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſtrength being exhauſted, was no way able by any help of <hi>Phiſitians</hi> to yield birth to the child that now remained dead in her wombe, therfore ſhe betooke her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe rather to prouide for the health of her ſoule then her body; when a certaine gyrle in the houſe, much giuen to piety, being not
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:17839:230"/>
ignorant how much power <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> had with Almighty God, imploreth his helpe, &amp; voweth that if that Noble Woman, might eſcape that imminent danger of death, ſhe would come, and preſent a votiue Tablet at his ſepulcher. This vow being made, the Noble Lady lying in her bed, without any detriment to herſelfe, is deliuered of the dead child, and at this very inſtant whilſt I write this, liueth in perfect health. In teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of this matter the gyrle which I ſpake of, brought a painted Tablet to this Bleſſed mans ſepulcher, which firſt of all others was hung vp there. All theſe particulars did I vnderſtand fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gyrle herſelf, wherof me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made in the acts of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> &amp; others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anthony Urban</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> a youth of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares of age, by trade a Tailour, being diſtempered in his head, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall diſtillation of ſharp and malignant humours, was ſwelled in the face, and in his eyes ſo weakned, that he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endure the aire nor the light: moreouer this young man afflicted with a feuer, kept his bed, where when for the ſpace of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he had continually layne, there grew in his left eye a white weft or ſcumme, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knob not vnlike a pearle; which for ſo much as it began in the ſight of his eye, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing by degrees round about the ſame, did ſo couer it, that taking away his whole ſight, it made the young man ſtarke blind of that eye; and for that much to his griefe that
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:17839:231"/>
acrimonious humour beginning to diffuſe it ſelfe, he was conſtrained daily to groane &amp; lament, it was much feared leaſt he might looſe the vſe of the other eye like wiſe. The <hi>Phiſitians</hi> attempted diuers times to apply ſeuerall medicines. But in reſpect either of the violence of the malady, or for that they were ouer late miniſtred to the young man, as being neglected in regard of his pouerty, inſteed of eaſe, they added to his affliction. That being diſcouered, the <hi>Phiſitian,</hi> when he had preſcribed certaine other remedies, which he found tooke no effect, gaue ouer the man as vncurable. Therfore this poore ſicke ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being deſtitute of all humane help and aſſiſtance, lay languiſhing in his bed, with that hard knob faſtned immouable vpon the ſight of his eye; the inflammation &amp; payne of both his eyes, did daily increaſe, the ſharpe humour did ſo much abound, that from both his eyes it continually ran vpon the bolſter, and in the night that clammy and viſcouſe matter, did ſo gum-vp his eyes, that it was very hard in the morning to get open either of them. Neither did any criſis, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or euacuation, or naturall ſweat, yield him any eaſe. And verily, hauing laid a ſide all hope of recouery, he was euery day worfe handled then other. By chance it fell out that an vncle of his, being by his trade a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when as he ſaw in the hands of a certaine boy, the liuely picture; of <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and asked of one that was in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:17839:231"/>
whether he knew this Bleſſed man; was giuen by this meanes to vnderſtand of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his miracles, and importuned to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe his ſicke Nephew to make ſome vow vnto <hi>B. Aloyſius.</hi> When he had condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therunto, he giueth order to a ſiſter of his to borrow the picture of that boy, carry it to the ſicke perſon, and perſuade him to make that vow. There this woman found herſelfe immediately inflamed with piety toward this Bleſſed man, and conceaued a certaine hope, that through his merits, he ſhould be cured, and that ſhe ſeemed to haue a fore-knowledge, that it ſhould be effected that very night. Hauing gotten the picture, ſetting aſide all delay, late in the euening ſhe bringeth it to the ſicke young man, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting what miracles he had wrought, exhorting him to make a vow to him, ſhe departeth. When <hi>Anthony</hi> had with a pious mind receaued the picture, full of vehement zeale toward this Bleſſed man, and hope of recouering his former health, he raiſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon his knees in his bed, and houlding the picture in his hands he voweth, that if by his recommendation he might receaue his ſight, he would daily in honour of him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite fiue <hi>Pator Nosters,</hi> and ſo many <hi>Aue-Maries:</hi> and repoſing great truſt in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour which he had with God, three times he ſigneth his blind eye there withall in the forme of a croſſe, and ſetteth the ſame after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behind his head. When he had ſlept
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:17839:232"/>
for the ſpace of fiue houres in the night, he thought in his ſleepe, that he was reſtored to his former health, and euen returned to his ſhop. Wakening about the ninth houre, when he found his eyes voyd of their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed paine, throughly cleanſed, and his eye-lyds opened, he began to imagine that he was perfectly recouered. But ſo ſuddai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely, was he able to make no certaine triall, by reaſon that he was in darkeneſſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling vpon his Vncle, he proclaymed that he did verily thinke he was deliuered out of his diſeaſe, for ſo much as neither his eyes did grieue him any more, and that his eye-lyds were opened, without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So ſoone as it was faire day <hi>Anthony</hi> when as he beheld the light, ſpeaking to his Aunt, who by chance came vnto him: I ſee (my good aunt) I ſee, ſaid he, I am ſound &amp; whole. By this voyce ſhe togeather with her brother being called to his bed ſide, find <hi>Anthonies</hi> eyes cleare, and freed from their accuſtomed humours and inflammation; &amp; in like manner the hard knobbe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did couer the ſight of his eye, was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the left corner of the ſame, now exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated and vaniſhing (and afterward wore a way abſolutely) leauing no impediment in his ſight. For this ſo manifeſt a fauour ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnto them, with all the ſerious induſtry that they might they preſently render than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to God and <hi>B. Aloyſius.</hi> The young man himſelfe, who before could by no meanes
<pb facs="tcp:17839:232"/>
brooke neither the ayre, nor light, leapeth out of his bed ſafe and ſound, goeth forth abroad, preſenteth himſelfe at Maſſe to giue thankes vnto God, and finally betaketh himſelfe not long after to his taylours trade. This miracle, after that, according to the cuſtome, audience had bene giuen vnto wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes by the authority of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Siena,</hi> was regiſtred, and many <hi>Phiſitians</hi> did teſtify vpon their oathes, that he could not be cured, but by diuine and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall force.</p>

For in the yeare 1600. in the moneth of Ianuary, by night being waked out of her ſleepe with a vehement diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cough, vnder her left pap, ſhe found as it were a certaine heauy burden to lye v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her, with a ſharpe paine, and the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, after a certaine ſort gnawne: when ſhe felt it with her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſhe found a thing as hard as marble, of the bigneſſe of an egge, which afterward was diſcouered to be a Canker.

Virgins there, the whole matter, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the ſame with <hi>Euangelista lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundia,</hi> and with <hi>Maria Magdalena de Pazzi</hi> Miſtreſſe of the Nouices, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently viſit the ſicke womans griefe, and by their handling therof, diſcouer that it was a Canker, which in like manner not very long before had occaſioned the death of a certaine other Virgin of the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery. Her miſtreſſe repoſing no confidence in naturall remedies, betaketh herſelfe to implore the helpe of God, and finding in her prayers a certaine inſtinct, that by way of fauour ſhe ſhould requeſt of B. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyſius</hi> to recommend this matter vnto God, ſhe exhorteth likewiſe the Virgin to do the ſame. Moreouer ſo ſoone as ſhe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how much was attributed to the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of B. <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> for three dayes one after another, ſhe with thoſe Reliques which I ſpake of before, ſigned her with the ſigne of the croſſe.

of mind to beſeech him that he would not ſuffer that day to paſſe (which was the 8. of Aprill, being Saturday in <hi>Albis,</hi> as they call it) without vouchſaſing her this fauour: that is to ſay; that ſhe might be made partaker of her health, not through humane helpes, but by his recommendation. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that all the whole day, in her ſacred me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, ſhe had implored that benefit, at laſt towards the euening reſpecting only the honour of God and his holy ſeruant, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireth herſelfe ſecretly into her cloſet to her prayers.

That ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day beginning to performe his vow, the next morning he went to honour the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> and to render thankes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſound and in perfect health: and the 22. of Iune, which is celebrated as the glorious day of his entrance into heauen, he faſtned at his Sepulcher a ſiluer tablet, in memory of that health, which by God, and his good helpe he had recouered, and finally vnder his oath he cauſed all theſe things to be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regiſtred.</p>
               <p>The greatneſſe of this miracle was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by that which happenned to a certaine man of <hi>Turino, Philibertus Baro,</hi> a very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gentleman, who being one night ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed with bitter paines of the ſtone, as being one of ſingular piety, betooke himſelfe to diuine help, and for obtaining of the ſame, addreſſed his prayers both to other Saints &amp; eſpecially to thoſe Bleſſed men of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of IESVS <hi>S.

But when as his paine from foure houres after ſun-ſet, for the ſpace of ſome nine houres, was ſo far from remitting that it euen increaſed, it came into his mind, that he had heard, about a moneth before that time, that a certaine young man at <hi>Rome</hi> was

by the prayers of <hi>B. Aloyſius</hi> admirably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered from the like diſeaſe. Therfore put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a hope, that he would likewiſe aſſiſt him, wheras he had none of his pictures, he commaunded that certaine letters written by the hand of the <hi>Beatus</hi> himſelfe, which were of late giuen him by a certaine Father, ſhould be brought, to that intent, that he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to himſelfe for the mittigating of the griefe of the ſtone. But when after much ſearch they could not be found, lifting vp his mind to Heauen, with as much feruour as he might, he inuocateth <hi>Bleſſed Aloyſius.</hi> After this, a light ſleepe ſtealeth vpon him, wherin there ſeemed to appeare vnto him the ſhape of a young man of our Society, rather of a tall, then low ſtature, his face ſlender and leane, his noſe aquiline, and ſomewhat long, who approaching neare to his bed, gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his reines, and his whole body round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a girdle. He who had neuer known <hi>Aloyſius</hi> by his face, not withſtanding ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that it was he, awaketh. But wheras he vaniſhed out of his ſight, whilſt he raiſed vp himſelfe, and endeauoured with veneration to imbrace him in his armes, he left a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine force and effect of his preſence. For at the very ſame inſtant he ſenſibly perceaued the ſtone falling from his reines into his bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for which immediatly he gaue thankes to God and <hi>B.

And to the intent that he might giue an open remonſtrance, that he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth this receipt of his health to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power of God, he ſent as a guiſe to the Sepulcher of <hi>Aloyſius</hi> a ſiluer tablet, and vpon his oath declared all theſe thinges before the Archbiſhop of <hi>Turino.</hi>

               <p>Moreouer, to the intent that this might be ſo much the more remarkable, it was the pleaſure of God that another miracle ſhould happen to the ſame child.

This may very well be vnderſtood by thoſe things which it hath pleaſed Almighty God to Vouchſafe in this kind.</p>
               <p>A young man of <hi>Polonia,</hi> being euen from his firſt childhood very much giuen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prayer, faſts, diſciplinings, and other afflictions of himſelfe, hauing lead a pious &amp; intiere life in the midſt of ſecular liberty, had at <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He in his very firſt entrance into a more holy life, began moſt grieuouſly to be ſolicited to admit wicked cogitations againſt God, the Bl.

Often did he beſeech Almighty God to help him; often did he implore the aide of the Virgin Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, often the aſſiſtance of other Saints. But
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:17839:256"/>
(for ſo much as perhaps they had rather haue this benefit aſcribed to B. Aloyſius his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, whome with ſo deuout a mind he had alwaies ſerued) his prayers deſerued not to be heard. Being now for the ſpace of two moneths infeſted with theſe troubleſome ſuggeſtions of the Diuell, when once by breake of day he was according to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome tempted with the ſame in his prayers, it came into his mind, to beſeech Almighty God to help him, by the mediation of <hi>B. Aloyſius Gonzaga,</hi> whom he had read in his life to haue aſſiſted others in the like danger. He offered vp vnto him his prayers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him earneſtly, that he would free him from this trouble. And without delay, he ſenſibly found his breſt filled not only with hope, but euen confidence, togeather with a certaine cheerfulneſſe, ſo far forth as if all that his deiection of mind had bene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. Neither was he deceaued in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, for from thence forward he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes free from the ſame. This thing he himſelfe (to the intent that he might propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the glory of B. Aloyſius) did of his owne accord relate vnto others, and vnder his oath publickly profeſſed.</p>
               <p>A certaine pious man dwelling in the Countrey beyond the Alpes, had paſſed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many yeares in Religion, &amp; ſeruice of God, ſecured from all luſt-full tentations, when by Gods permiſſion, with ſo great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence he began to be infeſted by an imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:17839:256"/>
ſpirit, that he was compelled all the whole yeare to maintaine battaile, and combat with diſhoneſt thoughts and imaginations, with vnchaſt incitements and ſenſuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations; neither in the meane while had he any comfort or reſt. He treated his poore body with hunger, ſtripes, haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and other aſperities both of diet and clothing. It auailed him nothing: ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would he withdraw himſelfe from the table, often from the company of men, being conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be wayle and bemoane his owne infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. There throwing himſelfe proſtrate in the very duſt, he perſeuered with humble prayers daily to petition Almighty God for mercy; finally finding no remedy whereby truly he could hope for any comfort, and perceauing his luſtfull deſires to be nothing leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e inkindled, he was aſſaulted likewiſe violently with that execrable opinion of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining, that neither God, nor any of his Saints tooke regard of our affaires, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily wearied with his importunate prayers, yielded notwithſtanding no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or reliefe to his vnfortunate ſtate.</p>
               <p>In concluſion when he had ſo lingred out the whole yeare in this difficult conflict, that he found no ſuccour at all, he remembred himſelfe of the holy and innocent life of B. <hi>Aloyſius Gonzaga,</hi> of which amongſt other thinges he had heard this eſpecially, that through a ſingular benefit of God, he had his body free from all vnchaſt motions, and
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:17839:257"/>
his mind from all, euen the leaſt ſhaddow, of ſinne. Therfore he determined to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto him as his laſt refuge, him he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought as earneſtly as he might; finally he hung about his neck his reliques which by chance he had in his cuſtody: ſcarcely had they touched him, when vpon the ſuddaine, he was exempted from the fury of all thoſe cogitations, and there was rendred vnto him a very pleaſing and quiet ſtate of mind: and two yeares are now paſt, ſince that (being freed from all thoſe manner of tentations) he aſcribeth this ſo great a benefit to B. Aloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, and by his aſſiſtance continueth it. Of all theſe thinges by publike authority a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was made, &amp; a Donary-offering of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was ſent to his tombe at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could rehearſe others of like kind, which I haue vnderſtood from very credible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, who do conſtantly affirme, that wheras formerly they had bene plunged ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually in a vice much oppoſite to chaſtity, after they began to make ſute for Gods help by the mediation of this his ſeruant, either by honouring his ſepulcher, or carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them his reliques or picture, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to do ſome pious thing in honour of him, or chooſing him for their aduocate and patron, thoſe vncleane ardours being as it were extinguiſhed, they neuer after pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their integrity with any ſuch like ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. But for ſo much as it is my purpoſe, to proſecute in this booke thoſe things only,
<pb facs="tcp:17839:257"/>
which I found recommended to publike monuments, and that I cannot declare theſe things, without drawing ſome note vpon them vnto whome they happened, I do willingly omit them.</p>
               <p>This only will I add, that if that ſaying of B. Aloyſius be true, as very true it is, which in his life time he maintayned, that the Saints of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do chiefly profeſſe their helpe and aſſiſtance to vs mortall men in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring thoſe vertues, with which they in their life time were adorned: ſeing that he did with ſo vnuſuall a prayſe flouriſh, not only in purity and chaſtity, but euen in very many other vertues, as heertofore we haue declared; without all doubt, being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued into heauen, he will moſt willingly be exceeding propitious vnto them, who haue recourſe vnto him, with a deſire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or preſerue thoſe vertues.</p>
               <p>And by theſe that haue bene related in this chapter we may eaſily coniecture, that almighty God, who eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now before his acts are as yet publiſhed, hath (by his prayers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>This Goſpell is likewiſe deſigned for the ſolemnity of all thoſe Angels, who togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>S.

of them to place before our eyes ſome part of that dignity and glory vouchſafed vnto them by our Lord. Therfore 3. thinges there are which are wont to illuſtrate the Court, or Army of a great Prince.

                  <p>Firſt of all conſider their Nature. For they chalenge vnto themſelues the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall place amongſt thoſe workes created by the omnipotent hand of God, that great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer: they are ſpirituall ſubſtances: by their owne nature incorruptible, and of all other creatures the moſt noble: of ſo great intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that in the notion of naturall things, they are exempted from all errour and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Likewiſe to this their ſo great light of Vnderſtanding, they haue their Will ſo firme and perfectly conformable, that it is not poſſible for it, either to be aſſaulted, or ouercome with any perturbation. But if you contemplate their ſtate, in which by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of grace they now remaine, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euer admitting any ſinne haue obtained glory, and eternall felicity. Moreouer, they are eſſentially adorned with the habit of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine grace, which rendreth them moſt faire and gracious in the ſight of Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>In their Vnderſtanding they are endowed with the cleare light of glory, wherby face to face they behold their creatour. And in their Wil habituated with charity, wherwith
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:17839:261"/>
louing God with the loue of perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they are made both the children and friends of the ſelfe-ſame God. Now therfore my Soule, contemplate the beauty of theſe celeſtiall Citizens, who like ſo many mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtars, yea euen moſt cleare ſunnes, ſhine moſt gloriouſly in the Citty of God, in which as in moſt cleare mirrours, are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s diuine, as infinite power, eternal wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ineffable goodneſſe, and moſt ardent loue of their creatour. O how amiable, how pure, and innocent-white are theſe Bleſſed ſpirits! How zealous of ſetting forth the glory of their Lord, how deſirous and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous of our ſaluation; and therfore moſt worthy to be by vs peculiarly loued &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. For if honour (as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay) be a certaine worſhip, which is due to ſome one in reſpect of the excellency or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which he hath in himſelfe, and therfore (although all men according vnto nature are equall one to another) we are wont to exhibit moſt honour vnto them, who excell others in ſome kind of prayſe: how much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought we, being ſo vile and abiect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in compariſon of theſe celeſtiall ſpirits, to attribute vnto them all honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? ſeing that euery one of them, how little ſoeuer he be, doth far excell, the moſt nobleſt of vs human creatures, in the abouenamed endowments &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies. Moreouer, if theſe holy Angels, being creatures ſo much exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue others in nature and grace, do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:17839:261"/>
themſelues to the honour of man-kind, in reſpect that God himſelfe hath loued and honoured the ſame; ſurely much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient it is, that we (moſt contemptible wormes) ſhould with all honour and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proſecute thoſe, whom God ſo much honoureth and exalteth in heauen. For theſe are the beloued children, <hi>who alwayes contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the face of their Father.

                  <p>Secondly, next to the dignity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this celeſtiall Court, conſider the number and order of the Courtiers therof.

                     <p>Next to the glorious Prince <hi>Michael,</hi> conſider the dignity and excellency of the prerogatiues of the Archangell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> who though in the Scriptures he be called an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, we ought not therfore to thinke, that he was of the loweſt order of Angells, who are peculiarly ſent for the help and miniſtery of men, but that he was aboue thoſe Angells, to wit, an Archangell, and amongſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changells, one of the principall. For as the

myſtery of the Annuntiation for which he came, was not common, but the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and moſt worthy amongſt all thoſe, which euer God did exhibit, ſo ought we to thinke that this diuine legate was one of the moſt nobleſt contained in that Hierarchy. This is the faythfull friend of the celeſtiall ſpouſe, who being made priuy to that moſt high ſecret of his Incarnation, did firſt of all publiſh it to the world. This is that gracious <hi>Para-nymph</hi> who was mediatour betweene that moſt high God, and this poore humble Virgin of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> betweene the Eternall word, and our humane Nature.</p>
                     <p>Now the better to vnderſtand the dignity of this Archangell, conſider ſeuerally the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices committed by our Lord vnto him. And firſt of all, as ſome holy men affirme, it may piouſly be belieued, that he was particularly aſſigned to the Bleſſed Virgin as her gardian. And as God had no other pure creature nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen nor earth, that was more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or did more feruently loue him then the Bleſſed Virgin Mary; ſo you may imagine, that as the Princes of this world are wont to commit thoſe thinges that are moſt deare vnto themſelues, to the cuſtody of thoſe Courtiers that are moſt faythfull, and moſt addicted vnto them: euen ſo in that celeſtiall Court, this glorious Angell Gabriell was worthily accounted with the King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, amongſt his beſt and deereſt.</p>

Furthermore this name of <hi>Gabriel</hi> more properly, is as much as to ſay <hi>Fortitudo Dei,</hi> the fortitude of God, and this to notify that myſtery, which he denounced to the world, that is to ſay, a moſt ſtrong and triple cord, to wit, the moſt ſtrict vnion of the Diuine nature, with the moſt holy body and ſoule of Chriſt, in one <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis,</hi> and perſon of the eternall word, as it is written: <hi>

not do, and this ſometimes by alluring thee by the examples of Chriſt our Lord and his Saints, ſometimes by inflaming thy will out of the conſideration of Gods bounty &amp; his infinite benefits, otherſome times alſo quickning thy Vnderſtanding, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of thy future iudgment, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of hell.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Scripture goeth forward to recount the benefits which <hi>Toby</hi> receaued from the Angell <hi>Raphael</hi> both according to his owne perſon, as alſo in reſpect of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> temporall goods. For when he came to the riuer <hi>Tigris,</hi> and was diſpoſed to waſh therin his feet, there ruſhed vpon him a cruell fiſh to deuoure him: but his Angell defended him, and reſchewed him from that danger, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that he ſhould take the gall therof for the reſtoring of his Fathers ſight, who was blind. Moreouer the ſelfe-ſame Angell did not only redeeme for <hi>Toby,</hi> that ſumme of mony for which he was ſent, but made him alſo heire ouer all the wealth of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law <hi>Raguel.</hi> Now what other thing do our Angels guardians do, but watch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, to yield vs help in all our neceſſities, no otherwiſe then a mother, that hath all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes her eyes ſet vpon her little child, leaſt it may perhaps fall, or incurre ſome other miſchiefe? Thinke therfore from how many corporall dangers he hath preſerued you, which might as well haue befallen you, as they haue done vnto others, and alſo how

ſolicitous he hath bene in procuring for you all temporall goods, as health, ſtrength, and other neceſſary ſupplies, that you might according to your calling, conueniently maintaine your life, and in that ſtate which may be moſt accommodated to the gayning of your ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, as the Angell <hi>Raphael</hi> (as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayth) did chalenge vnto himſelfe as his proper office, to offer vp vnto God the prayers and good workes of <hi>Toby;</hi> ſo our Angell-Guardian, exerciſeth in the behalfe of vs, the office of a Solicitour in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, offering vp our prayers, and deſires, and whatſoeuer good workes we doe, and is alwayes bringing vnto vs ſome one guift or other of Diuine grace. O that we could but ſee, with how great diligence the holy Angels ſometimes aſcend, ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes deſcend for our ſakes, as they did vpon that ladder ſeen by <hi>Iacob</hi> the Patriarch: they aſcend declaring our neceſſities, and beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching God that he would beſtow vpon vs, his diuine mercy: and they deſcend brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging backe from our heauenly Father his holy inſpirations, good thoughts, and other diuine helpes, and ſometimes likewiſe ſome Fatherly correction, that he may excite vs, and that we may examine our ſelues, <hi>leaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with this world we be condemned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, as the Angell <hi>Raphael</hi> taught <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> the meanes which he ought to obſerue in putting the Diuell to flight, that he might

For theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are thoſe faythfull watchmen, which our Lord ſayth are placed vpon the wals of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to keep in the vigils of the night his flocke, leaſt that infernall wolfe our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary, like a furious lion make prey vpon our ſoules.

                        </gap> alſo by corroborating &amp; encouraging vs in ſtriuing with tentations and afflictions, and finally obtaining of our Lord fortitude that we may go away with the victory.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, as the Angell <hi>Raphael</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the diuell, bound him in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:17839:273"/>

Furthermore, after that the ſoule hath departed from the body, the ſame Angell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth her, comforteth and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth her that ſhe ſhould confidently appeare before the tribunall of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſetting before her eyes the moſt pretious merits of IESVS-Chriſt, in which ſhe ought confidently to truſt at the time of her iudgment. And if for the expiating of the reliques of her ſinnes ſhe ſhall be adiudged to Purgatory, there he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten viſiteth her, comforteth her, certifieth her of the prayers of pious perſons that are offered vp for her in the world, and finally biddeth her be ſecure that ſhe ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in time to come.</p>
                     <p>As concerning thy third ſtate, and that which ſhall be thy laſt, conſider what in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion the Angell <hi>Raphael</hi> did: namely how when he had aſſigned a wife to young <hi>Toby,</hi>

Alas, ô my God, and therfore ſhall I deſpaire? No verily. For ſeing that thy mercy is inexhauſtible, and that in the perſon of that good Father in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, thou dideſt with ſo great charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce aue thy penitent ſonne.

                     <p n="2">2. Moreouer our Lord ſaid: <hi>Qui humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liauerit ſe, ſicut paruulus iste, erit maior inregno celorum, Matth.</hi> 18. He that ſhall humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, like this little child, ſhall be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the kingdome of heauen. Very well therfore ſaid the Apoſtle, that the wiſedome of the fleſh was an enemy, and contrary to the wiſedome of God: for in the world they are thought to be the greateſt, who diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vphould the ſtate and degree of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſtimation, whome God maketh no account of at all. But on the contrary part, they that haue no regard at all of their honour, and endeauour to humble themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:17839:276"/>
euen vnder the feet of all others, theſe are truly great in the ſight of God, and ſhall be likewiſe in heauen more great then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, according to the ſaying of the wiſe man: <hi>Quanto maior es, humilia te in omnibus: &amp; coram Deo inuenies gratiam. Eccl.</hi> 3. The greater thou art, humble thy ſelfe in all thinges: and thou ſhalt find grace before God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. How much the leſſe a man ſhall make himſelfe then others, ſo much the greater ſhall he be made, becauſe how much the humbler euery one is, ſo much the liker and more allied he is vnto Chriſt, who is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour vnto all. Which if it be ſo, Chriſtians and ſpirituall men ſhould not contend for any precedence, or prerogatiue of honour but rather for the laſt place; for he that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at the firſt place vpon earth, ſhall find himſelfe diſgraced in heauen. Let vs not therfore endeauour to ſeeme greater then others, but rather let vs make our ſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to all, for he is neuer awhit the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or the better, who is more honourable; but rather how much the more iuſt a man is, ſo much the more honour is he worthy of.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If ſo much reuerence be to be exhibited to the Angell-keepers, that, as our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth it vnto vs, for their reſpect we ought not to contemne one of theſe little ones. And in like manner the Apoſtle coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled women, that they ſhould couer their heads, leaſt perhaps they might with their vanity or indecency, offend thoſe Angels
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:17839:276"/>
that were deſirous of the helping forward of humane ſaluation: how much more ought we to be wary, leaſt by iniury or ſome other more grieuous hurt we offend our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for by offeding them we offend their Angels, who as the friendes and inward do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticalls of God, will require reuenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, and without all doubt obtaine it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And if the Angels imploy ſo great care and induſtry in the cuſtody of men, and yet notwithſtanding ceaſe not, from behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the face of their heauenly Father, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which ſhall come to paſſe, when according to the example of the holy Angels, they ſhall effect, that the externall actions may proceed, and take their efficacy from the internal, that is to ſay, that they may be vndertaken for no other end, then for the pure loue of God.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They who take the care to bring men to Pennance, ought neuer to deſiſt from their enterpriſe, out of tediouſneſſe of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or for that they feare this labour ſhall

Wherfore they do not ceaſe as long as they are in this life &amp; in ſtate that they may returne to God by Pennance to excite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to amedment. <hi>Seneca</hi> a Pagan Philoſopher, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a certaine friend of his admoniſheth him, that if in his actions &amp; ſpeaches he wold not depart from a right <hi>decorum,</hi> that he ſhold alwayes imagine there was preſent with him <hi>Cato,</hi> as his ſeuere cenſurer. Of which docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much more wee Chriſtians ought to make vſe, and to imagine that in all our actions our good Angel-keepers are alwayes preſent, as our ſeuere cenſurers, to the end, that this cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may make vs mindfull of our ſelues, and that we may carefully waigh whatſoeuer we wold ſay or do: for if we ſhall doe otherwiſe, we may iuſtly feare, leaſt they that are now our aduocates with God, may afterward, at the day of iudgment, become our accuſers.</p>
